see stroy

 Allegations of elections day campaigning dampened voting at the Capital Bye Pass precinct in Central Monrovia Tuesday later resulting into a sea of confusion and argument between the Liberia National Police and Acarous Gray, Secretary General of the Congress for Democratic Change.

At issue were concerns by LNP officers that Gray should not have taken a party vehicle with the partyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emblem at the center where he went to cast his ballot.

Gray told reporters present during his scuffle with the LNP that the confusion started after he was ordered by LNP officer Darlington George to remove his partyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s initial from his vehicle which he refused to do.

Gray further explained that the vehicle was parked in front of his house and that he was not carrying any campaign material. Gray said to his surprise, the next thing he saw was a Police car which came close to hitting his vehicle. Gray further explained that the next thing he noticed was Officer George getting down from his vehicle and ordering him not to use the vehicle any more.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“You know it is unfortunate that a guy like that lacks moral credentials because if you go all around you will see Ellen Johnson Sirleaf posters, in front of her house, at the Antoinette Tubman Stadium (ATS), go all over the City of Monrovia, you will see her photos, campaign materials all over which officer George did not consider a violation. So why am I in violation,Ã¢â‚¬Â Gray said.

The CDC Secretary General narrated that he was approached in a very rude and unorganized manner which he says was a violation of his human rights.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of November the run-off elections takes place. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To vote is an individual democratic right Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it is your personal right and it is your personal choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Liberia who wish to exercise their right to vote, should be able to do so in peace and without intimidation &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peaceful, credible, and transparent elections are important to ensure that the peace in Liberia is maintained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the past Eight (8) years UNMIL has been here to help ensure that peace is maintained in Liberia. We are here today and on November 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and the days to follow, to continue to protect Liberia as they exercise their individual democratic rights.Ã‚Â  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will see UNMIL staff, police and military on the streets and in the air all around the country &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦We are here to ensure everything is peaceful and Ã¢â‚¬Â¦We are here to deter anyone who intends to destroy the peace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;International observers from ECOWAS, from the AU, the Carter Center and others are here to monitor the whole election processÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but it is &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Liberia voters&lt;/strong&gt; who have to decide whether you will contribute to consolidating democracy and peace in Liberia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But first and foremost, regardless of your political views, I appeal to all Liberia to say no to violence on Election Day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“Liberia is all you haveÃ¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â€œ help build it democratically, do not destroy it violently.&lt;/li&gt;

"&lt;p&gt;From the Liberia New Dawn online newspaper, Nov 7th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States State Department has strongly condemned Cllr.  WinstonTubmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Congress for Democratic Change or the CDC for  boycotting the November 8 presidential runoff election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A State Department statement issued under the signature of Victoria  Nuland, spokesperson on the Liberia elections, indicated that United  States government is deeply disappointed by the decision of the CDC to  boycott the runoff election.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å“The CDC's charge that the  first-round election was fraudulent is unsubstantiated. As evidenced by  international and domestic observers, Liberia's October 11 first-round  presidential and legislative elections were fair, free and transparent,Ã¢â‚¬Â  said Madam Nuland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to her, Washington supports the  LiberiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s democratic process moving forward, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are supportive of  moving forward with the November 8 election as called for by the  National Elections Commission,Ã¢â‚¬Â the United States official maintained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Å“Participation  in elections is a fundamental part of democracy. We commend all  Liberia for their peaceful participation in the elections, and  encourage all Liberia to exercise their political voice and vote on  November 8,Ã¢â‚¬Â Madam Nuland stressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said that the United  States government and its people commend the leadership of ECOWAS and  note the important contributions of UNMIL in promoting security during  the electoral period, as well as working with all sides to protect the  integrity of Liberia's democracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile, Madam Victoria  Nuland has reassured the Liberia populace that the international  community, including the United States, will again send observers to  monitor the election process.&lt;/p&gt;","Ushahidi Liberia","2011-11-07 11:02:00",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
"&lt;p&gt;From AllAfrica.com website, an article originally published by the Liberia newspaper, the Analyst on Nov 7th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the Constitution of Liberia and the Election Laws of Liberia  mandate a runoff candidate, who had filed complaints to NEC, to prepare  for participation even while, not after, NEC looked into the  complaints. Current trends indicate that CDC had flouted that mandate;  and, from all indications, it appears unprepared to participate in  tomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s runoff. CDC says it is not participating because NEC  defaulted; NEC says if it defaulted, that was because CDC did everything  to filibuster the proceedings even thought it did not have to conclude  everything before the runoff date. However, PresidentEllenJohnsonSirleaf has  different idea: CDC boycotts becauseWinstonTubman is afraid of defeat. The  Analyst, reports.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do not succumb to fear and intimidation.Ã‚Â  Do not allow any  politician to hold our country hostage.Ã‚Â  Do not allow Mr.WinstonTubman to  falsely claim Ã¢â‚¬ËœboycottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ when what he is doing is forfeiting the right to  the finals because he fears defeat!Ã¢â‚¬Â These words of encouragement to  the Liberia people were contained the statement President Ellen EllenJohnsonSirleaf delivered on November 5, 2011, before an array of  government officials, political and religious leaders, and civil society  representatives on November 5, 2011.

&lt;p&gt;Al Jazeera's Yvonne Ndege, in Monrovia, said that she was shown the  bodies of three men who had been killed by police during the protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The entire area where the opposition party HQ is situated has been  boarded up. Riot rounds have been fired, tear gas has been fired, ' she  said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""Opposition supporters took me into their HQ firsthand and showed me  three dead bodies of young men that they allege were shot  indiscriminately at by the Liberia police for simply protesting about  the decision to continue with tomorrow's presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""It's an extremely bloody scene. It's so bloody, in fact, that the  United Nations has sent tanks down here and peacekeepers to try and stop  the confrontation between the Liberia police and those protesters.""&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One police officer at the scene said aÃ‚Â supporter of the opposition  party, the Congress for Democratic Change (CDC), fired the first shot  prompting police to shoot back, after officers had earlier responded to  stone throwers with tear gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an eye witness blamed the security forces for the flare-up and the deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""He was standing in front of the building when a policeman shot and I saw him going down,"" said witness Anita Mulba.&lt;/p&gt;

"&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;AFP News online: ""Monrovia- Liberia's main opposition has called  for a mass protest on Monday, on the eve of a run-off election which  candidate WinstonTubman is boycotting over fears the process will be  flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;Tubman, who set the country on  edge with his call for voters to stay away from Tuesday's run-off  presidential election, said he wants his supporters to stage a ""peaceful  protest"" on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;A vigil outside his Congress for  Democratic Change headquarters on Saturday and Sunday drew only a  handful of people, far from the tens of thousands which spilled into the  streets ahead of the first round polls on October 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;The boycott call raised tensions  in the last days of an election campaign which fizzled out on Sunday as  the CDC was absent and a last tour through the capital by President  EllenJohnsonSirleaf failed to draw the crowds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;Addressing the populous Red Light  market district, the Nobel Peace Prize winner praised her country's  eight years of peace after a brutal 14-year conflict which left some 250  000 dead ended in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;'I know that nobody in this country, no matter what the talk or rhetoric, nobody really wants us to go back to war,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;Tubman  claims the first round, in which he placed second with 32.7 percent of  the vote, was flawed by irregularities, and he has refused to take part  in the run-off until he is satisfied the process will be transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;Sirleaf got 43.9 percent in the  first round and has since won the support of key smaller parties such as  that of Prince Johnson, a notorious former warlord who was filmed  ordering the torture of military dictator Samuel Doe and who scored  nearly 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;The election has been billed as a  chance for the country to cement its fragile democracy and the  international community has condemnedWinstonTubman's boycott call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;'We are very concerned. It's a bad  signal ... political leaders must be prepared to win or lose,' the head  of the African Union observer mission, Speciosa Wadira Kazibwe, a  former Ugandan vice-president, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;The United States on Saturday said  it was 'deeply disappointed"" by the boycott call, callingWinstonTubman's  claims of fraud 'unsubstantiated"".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;West Africa's political bloc  ECOWAS said it ""deeply regrets the retrogressive tone"" ofWinstonTubmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s  statement and urged all involved ""not to miss this historic opportunity  of consolidating democracy and peace in the country"".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;Unity Party supporter Lucy Moore said that just two days before the election, she was both happy and sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;""Happy because I know we are going to win no matter what. Sad because we are going alone to the polls.""&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;Ciafa G Clarke, 29, an economics  student andWinstonTubman supporter told AFP that if the vote went ahead, ""the  vast majority of the people will not recognise the regime"".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;UN leader Ban Ki-moon has urged  the rival sides to maintain calm and ""not to resort to violence despite  political disagreement and to ensure that the peace in Liberia is  maintained"".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;Liberia, Africa's oldest  independent state, was founded by freed American slaves in 1847 and is  still scarred by the 14-year civil war which shattered infrastructure  and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sirleaf, who is hailed abroad for  her role in rebuilding the nation, has said she wants a second term to  rebuild the 'broken country' which is still heavily reliant on an 8  000-strong UN peacekeeping mission.""&lt;/p&gt;","Ushahidi Liberia","2011-11-07 15:08:00",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of November the run-off elections takes place. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To vote is an individual democratic right Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it is your personal right and it is your personal choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Liberia who wish to exercise their right to vote, should be able to do so in peace and without intimidation &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peaceful, credible, and transparent elections are important to ensure that the peace in Liberia is maintained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the past Eight (8) years UNMIL has been here to help ensure that peace is maintained in Liberia. We are here today and on November 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and the days to follow, to continue to protect Liberia as they exercise their individual democratic rights.Ã‚Â  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will see UNMIL staff, police and military on the streets and in the air all around the country &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦We are here to ensure everything is peaceful and Ã¢â‚¬Â¦We are here to deter anyone who intends to destroy the peace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;International observers from ECOWAS, from the AU, the Carter Center and others are here to monitor the whole election processÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but it is &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Liberia voters&lt;/strong&gt; who have to decide whether you will contribute to consolidating democracy and peace in Liberia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But first and foremost, regardless of your political views, I appeal to all Liberia to say no to violence on Election Day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“Liberia is all you haveÃ¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â€œ help build it democratically, do not destroy it violently.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Jazeera's Yvonne Ndege, in Monrovia, said that she was shown the  bodies of three men who had been killed by police during the protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The entire area where the opposition party HQ is situated has been  boarded up. Riot rounds have been fired, tear gas has been fired, ' she  said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""Opposition supporters took me into their HQ firsthand and showed me  three dead bodies of young men that they allege were shot  indiscriminately at by the Liberia police for simply protesting about  the decision to continue with tomorrow's presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;""It's an extremely bloody scene. It's so bloody, in fact, that the  United Nations has sent tanks down here and peacekeepers to try and stop  the confrontation between the Liberia police and those protesters.""&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One police officer at the scene said aÃ‚Â supporter of the opposition  party, the Congress for Democratic Change (CDC), fired the first shot  prompting police to shoot back, after officers had earlier responded to  stone throwers with tear gas.&lt;/p&gt;

"&lt;p&gt;From AllAfrica.com website, an article originally published by the Liberia newspaper, the Analyst on Nov 7th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the Constitution of Liberia and the Election Laws of Liberia  mandate a runoff candidate, who had filed complaints to NEC, to prepare  for participation even while, not after, NEC looked into the  complaints. Current trends indicate that CDC had flouted that mandate;  and, from all indications, it appears unprepared to participate in  tomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s runoff. CDC says it is not participating because NEC  defaulted; NEC says if it defaulted, that was because CDC did everything  to filibuster the proceedings even thought it did not have to conclude  everything before the runoff date. However, PresidentEllenJohnsonSirleaf has  different idea: CDC boycotts becauseWinstonTubman is afraid of defeat. The  Analyst, reports.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do not succumb to fear and intimidation.Ã‚Â  Do not allow any  politician to hold our country hostage.Ã‚Â  Do not allow Mr.WinstonTubman to  falsely claim Ã¢â‚¬ËœboycottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ when what he is doing is forfeiting the right to  the finals because he fears defeat!Ã¢â‚¬Â These words of encouragement to  the Liberia people were contained the statement President Ellen EllenJohnsonSirleaf delivered on November 5, 2011, before an array of  government officials, political and religious leaders, and civil society  representatives on November 5, 2011. The president organized the  occasion to mark the conclusion of the electoral process, which NEC  initiated in January this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A State Department statement issued under the signature of Victoria  Nuland, spokesperson on the Liberia elections, indicated that United  States government is deeply disappointed by the decision of the CDC to  boycott the runoff election.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ã¢â‚¬Å“The CDC's charge that the  first-round election was fraudulent is unsubstantiated. As evidenced by  international and domestic observers, Liberia's October 11 first-round  presidential and legislative elections were fair, free and transparent,Ã¢â‚¬Â  said Madam Nuland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to her, Washington supports the  LiberiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s democratic process moving forward, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are supportive of  moving forward with the November 8 election as called for by the  National Elections Commission,Ã¢â‚¬Â the United States official maintained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ã¢â‚¬Å“Participation  in elections is a fundamental part of democracy. We commend all  Liberia for their peaceful participation in the elections, and  encourage all Liberia to exercise their political voice and vote on  November 8,Ã¢â‚¬Â Madam Nuland stressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said that the United  States government and its people commend the leadership of ECOWAS and  note the important contributions of UNMIL in promoting security during  the electoral period, as well as working with all sides to protect the  integrity of Liberia's democracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile, Madam Victoria  Nuland has reassured the Liberia populace that the international  community, including the United States, will again send observers to  monitor the election process.&lt;/p&gt;","Ushahidi Liberia AEP","2011-11-07 11:02:00",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;AFP News online: ""Monrovia- Liberia's main opposition has called  for a mass protest on Monday, on the eve of a run-off election which  candidate WinstonTubman is boycotting over fears the process will be  flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;Tubman, who set the country on  edge with his call for voters to stay away from Tuesday's run-off  presidential election, said he wants his supporters to stage a ""peaceful  protest"" on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;A vigil outside his Congress for  Democratic Change headquarters on Saturday and Sunday drew only a  handful of people, far from the tens of thousands which spilled into the  streets ahead of the first round polls on October 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;The boycott call raised tensions  in the last days of an election campaign which fizzled out on Sunday as  the CDC was absent and a last tour through the capital by President  EllenJohnsonSirleaf failed to draw the crowds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;Addressing the populous Red Light  market district, the Nobel Peace Prize winner praised her country's  eight years of peace after a brutal 14-year conflict which left some 250  000 dead ended in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;'I know that nobody in this country, no matter what the talk or rhetoric, nobody really wants us to go back to war,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;Tubman  claims the first round, in which he placed second with 32.7 percent of  the vote, was flawed by irregularities, and he has refused to take part  in the run-off until he is satisfied the process will be transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;Sirleaf got 43.9 percent in the  first round and has since won the support of key smaller parties such as  that of Prince Johnson, a notorious former warlord who was filmed  ordering the torture of military dictator Samuel Doe and who scored  nearly 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;The election has been billed as a  chance for the country to cement its fragile democracy and the  international community has condemnedWinstonTubman's boycott call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;'We are very concerned. It's a bad  signal ... political leaders must be prepared to win or lose,' the head  of the African Union observer mission, Speciosa Wadira Kazibwe, a  former Ugandan vice-president, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;The United States on Saturday said  it was 'deeply disappointed"" by the boycott call, callingWinstonTubman's  claims of fraud 'unsubstantiated"".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;West Africa's political bloc  ECOWAS said it ""deeply regrets the retrogressive tone"" ofWinstonTubmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s  statement and urged all involved ""not to miss this historic opportunity  of consolidating democracy and peace in the country"".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;Unity Party supporter Lucy Moore said that just two days before the election, she was both happy and sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;""Happy because I know we are going to win no matter what. Sad because we are going alone to the polls.""&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;Ciafa G Clarke, 29, an economics  student andWinstonTubman supporter told AFP that if the vote went ahead, ""the  vast majority of the people will not recognise the regime"".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;UN leader Ban Ki-moon has urged  the rival sides to maintain calm and ""not to resort to violence despite  political disagreement and to ensure that the peace in Liberia is  maintained"".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=""arcticle_text""&gt;Liberia, Africa's oldest  independent state, was founded by freed American slaves in 1847 and is  still scarred by the 14-year civil war which shattered infrastructure  and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sirleaf, who is hailed abroad for  her role in rebuilding the nation, has said she wants a second term to  rebuild the 'broken country' which is still heavily reliant on an 8  000-strong UN peacekeeping mission.""&lt;/p&gt;","Ushahidi Liberia AEP","2011-11-07 15:08:00",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
"This so sad for us as Liberia. For starters, it's a bad image to portray to an international community we are trying to attract for further developmental progress in our country. Most importantly, it's scary for us as Liberia and disappointing  that we have to constantly be presented  with these kinds of uprisings that makes us question if we will ever be able to abandon some of the vigilante attributes acquired during our war in an effort to move forward. Barkue, thanks for reporting what you are witnessing as you have that right that some of us understand and appreciate. From my understanding you spoke to a situation unfolding in the country from your viewpoint. I don't recall you accusing any one group of people as being the culprits. You only mentioned CDC in reference to their headquarters being an area marker for the conflict YOU are witnessing.

Even your leader acknowledge that there was a chance for mayhem or chaos, but yet, even though, there was a chance of violence, you all went ahead.  All the news media have indicated that there was an exchange of guns fire..where did that come from? were the police shooting at themselves? did the UN support the police to shoot CDC?  I guess all the cars that were attacked today the had ""RL""plates on it were also done by the police? I guess the car that was attacked today because CDC thought mary broh was in it, was done by the police as well? In the cause of what people? What is the cause Mawine? What cause are you promoting? the cause of the ""massive fraud"" that was only an exaggeration? the massive fraud that one has yet to see any evidence?

I think that we need to pay very close attention to whats going on, AS Liberia. First, there is a media campaign against CDC, framing them as people who want to bring war, break the law, and get into power by all means. THIS IS UNTRUE, if you have followed the elections without being aligned with any party. Even during their campaign during the 1st round elections, their rally was guarded and blocked by UNMIL and LNP. The people did not allow this to push them, they went on peacefully as the vowed to. Honestly, in regards to the LNP and UNMIL, I am not at all surprised. POWER BY ALL MEANS.

If they boycott the elections their partisans wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn out, which would drop the number even further.

At the end of the day, the number of voters will be really small and CDC will come out and say: yes UP won, but only by a fraction of the population so therefore PresidentEllenJohnsonSirleaf does not have a clear mandate.  In addition, the leadership saves face from a massive defeat (esp.  with both Prince Johnson and Charles Brumskine supporting UP)...they can always argue: hey, we really did not lose...we were not in the elections anyway.   Anyway, my advice to registered votersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦go out and vote regardless of which side youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on.","Liberia Elections","2011-11-07 13:57:00","Kimmie Weeks",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

There people get on here and make all types of threats and how power will be taken by force if monkey don't come down and instead of condeming it, they justify it. We have seen violent acts from CDC on several occasion, so I don't see why the idea of them stoning the police is so unbelievable.

"Retyped from the Heritage Vol. 17 No. 9 November 7, 2011

Republic of Liberia
National Elections Commission
Press Release

The National Elections Commission (NEC) wishes to categorically state that there is no constitutional or statuatory provision under Liberia Laws that allows withdraws of a candidate or party at this stage of the electoral process.

There is a specified procedure for withdrawal of a candidate, political party, coalition, or alliance as provided for in the candidate nomination procedure for the 2011 elections.

The procedure states that ""where the Commission has approved the candidature of an independent candidate, political party, coalition, alliance, or candidate of such parties.

Such candidate may be withdrawn by submitting a Declaration of Withdrawal Form (CN-11) to the Commission, only under the signatures of the head of party, coalition, or alliance and the candidate.

Candidates must submit the forms no later than forty-eight hours before the publication of the Final List of Candidates.  In the case of an independent candidate, his/her signature shall be sufficient notice of such withdrawal.  No independent candidate, political party, coalition, alliance or candidate of such parties may withdraw an approved candidature after the final list of candidates has been published.

Consistent with Article 83(b) of the 1986 Constitution of the Republic of Liberia, the NEC wishes to assure the people of Liberia that the November 8 Presidential Run-off election will be held as scheduled.  Contrary to the Congress for Democratic Change allegation that its grievances were not addressed, the NEC states that all complaints from the CDC are been given due process.

An official invitation was extended to the CDC for a meeting with the NEC on November, 2011 to discuss issues raised to its letter to the NEC on November 1, 2011 but the meeting was not honored by the CDC.

It should be recalled that on five different occasions, the CDC requested postponement of its own case for various reasons, including gathering and preparation of witnesses.  To date, the CDC has not completed that process; as a result, the case is still pending.

Meanwhile, all activities befitting the Presidential Run-off election, including the training of poll staff, packaging and deployment of electoral materials across the country, as well as security protection for the entire process are progressing as planned.  The NEC is therefore calling on all registered voters to turnout en mass on November 8, 2011 to exercise their Constitutional franchise by peacefully voting for the leaders of their choice.","Liberia Elections","2011-11-07 12:23:24","W.

"Re: The Liberia elections and CDC's boycott.  This is what I suspect:  CDC has calculated that second round of elections usually have lower turnouts. If they boycott the elections their partisans wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn out, which would drop the number even further.  UP voters will also be reluctant to turn out because they'll feel their party has already won (why get that ugly ink on your finger if your party will win).   At the end of the day, the number of voters will be really small and CDC will come out and say: yes UP won, but only by a fraction of the population so therefore PresidentEllenJohnsonSirleaf does not have a clear mandate.  In addition, the leadership saves face from a massive defeat (esp.  with both Prince Johnson and Charles Brumskine supporting UP)...they can always argue: hey, we really did not lose...we were not in the elections anyway.

"What is going on again in Liberia? Why are some people trying to undermine the progress the country is making? I agree that it has been the practice for some African leaders or dictators to rig elections. it is  also becoming the practice for every African opposition group to claim elections have been stolen by the incumbent or vice versa. It is because of this trend that the conduct of elections are subjected to international observation and scrutiny. The international community has given credibility to the conduct and results of the Liberia October 11, 2011 elections. If people in Liberia think that the international community is in a conspiracy againt them, then it is just too bad....because it is a battle they just can't win.

"Update On CDC Clash: Was out and about a short while to get first hand details on CDC demo this afternoon. Happened that CDC supporters left their compound and moved on to the street in the vicinity of Old Road Injunction. Were stopped by police officers on orders not to allow the march to go, as they never had permit to carry on. As the crowd was very huge, the force was gradually breaking the police defence line and pockets of rampaging rioters found alternative routes on the road heading to Kailondo and from there began surging in the direction of the old road junction. At this point, the Police fired tear gas to disperse the rushing crowd. Moments later, gunfire was heard ringing over Congo town. Spoke to one police officer and he said the gunfire came from the direction of CDC headquarters. Spoke to some CDC supporters and they claimed the shooting was directed in the crowd. Things are still sketchy but various reports are citing at least one dead, though CDC supporters claim three persons were killed.

"When my brother W. Gyude Moore, first added me to this forum I thought it an exciting chance to engage in constructive debate on the central issues confronting Liberia (and we all love politics). However, I quickly realised that the group had degenerated into a forum for ""partisan rum shop arguments"" and so I refrained from commentary. At times I even chastised my brother for the tone of his contributions. 

The tone in  this group is reflected on the streets of Monrovia today. It saddens me to see that even as the events of today unfold the harsh and non-constructive tone and divisive language of some of Liberia's most gifted and fortuitous children continues. Most of the Participants of this group represent many of Liberia's most talented and privileged the onus is on all of us to exercise greater responsibility.

The brainwashed voice of CDC leaders you mean? It's one thing to see the vulnerability and profit through votes and another to keep using the ""mind control"" to build or reawaken a ""monster"". How do you have the ""people"" at heart when lives lost is not enough to stop and reason? Are we not learning from our history? t's very important to consider/acknowledge the current mentality of who you're dealing with in a situation like this. It's irresponsible to encourage a disciplined act like boycott to people with such low comprehension/reasoning level. It's simple psychology!

"Liberia National Police, like many other aspects of our country's path to recovery is flawed. Police show of force today using lethal weapons was WRONG in all shapes and form; CDC protest escalation into rioting was UNLawful...Keep in mind, a strong and stable Liberia will require law enforcement that is trained on all aspects...simply vilifying the LNP, CDCians and rest of the gov't is not gonna help anyone...Let's seek justice but let's seek how and what can be done to push Liberia forward. Don't stall with too much focus on what's wrong, let's focus on how we can fix it. It's sad that the very power to fix it - VOTES will not be utilized (CDC's boycott). Nonetheless, Liberia is on a path to recovery and it's up to us to decide if we want to spend the next couple of days/weeks/months/yrs down in the trenches, fighting among ourselves on who's better and who's more evil, stalling our progress while the rest of the world goes on...OR find ways that WE can move forward. Power to make the right changes is not inherently tied to ""elections"" or having the ""seat of authority"". Leadership comes in all forms and leadership that will help Liberia is one that will unite us ALL and bring True peace and reconciliation. Now THIS is on us ALL!

"Courtesy of WIKI-OUT LIBERIA INVESTIGATORS:Fellow contributors, as u all may know, i informed you all about a very sensitive information THAT I GOT YESTERDAY FROM THE CONGRESS FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (CDC)  revealing  how the CDC had  planned to  protest in mornovia so as to  disrupt the electoral process in the name of a peace macrh. In that post, i hinted that there were planns by the CDC to besiege the city and its envrions, but some colleagues chose to debunk me on the issue. Moses Brown of the Women Democracy radio even went as far as lavishing insults at me. But as i always indicated that i will never post lie on this page, the CDC definately proved me right today. Their ""civil or peaceful protest""  placed the entire city under hostage today. Shops and marketeers were force to  close down before their normal closing hours. Now, as i post this piece, the CDC zealots are still regrouping themselves at their congo town headquarters to continue their  mayhem which left the newly built and higly praised gas station of george kailondo completely vandalized today to other areas mainly new kru town, vai town, clara town, red-light, duala and central monrovia. the aim of these planned act is to instill fear into the minds of voters so that they can be prevented form casting their votes in the impending run-off polls, according to what i am gathering from a secret CDC meeting which is ongoing now at the last floor of their congo town headquarters. According to waht i have also gathered, they will also be parrading with the caskets of those who were allegedly killed today in the streets during this protest. they will latter take the corpses to the US embassy, ECOWA, CHINESE EMBASSY, AND THE OFFFICES OF THE AU.AFTER WHICH, THE WILL NOW PROCEED TO A LOCAL FUNERAL HOME where the  BODIES would be kept for FOR BURIAL.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-07 21:44:33","Boima Justin Vaney Boima",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"It is sadden that we are engaging in activities that have the potential to undermine the fragile peace we currently enjoy without reflecting our most recent past. The gathering should have been peaceful as claimed by CDC but it turned violent when stones were threw from the crowd, shortly followed by the PoliceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reaction. So so sadden having viewed the pictures on the internet. Therefore, I would like to use this medium to appeal to the consciousness of all Liberia to refrain from all acts of violence and engage in constructive dialogue to mend our differences. There are always better alternatives, violence cannot resolve any problem, rather deepen the wounds, breed hatred and to a greater extend make us insensitive to the general well-being of society.
Chapter 1 Article 1 of the constitution reads: ""All power is inherent in the people. All free governments are instituted by their authority and for their benefit and they have the right to alter and reform the same when their safety and happiness so require. In order to ensure democratic government which responds to the wishes of the governed, the people shall have the right at such period, and in such manner as provided for under this constitution to cause their public servants to leave office and to fill vacancies by elections and appointments"". In my opinion, as provided for under the constitution, it is the right of all Liberia (18 + and properly registered electorate) to exercise their franchise in the electoral process. As such, under on condition should this right be denied or people be coaxed from exercising it. If for whatsoever reasons people are happy/unhappy with the current regime, simply vote ELLEN orWinstonTubman but remember to have Liberia at heart in making that decision, in terms of, who can transform the country, reconcile the people and make the country a better place for our children children...

Police Director Marc Amblard confirmed the move late Monday night, on the eve of the November 8 presidential run-off, following the riot at the CDC headquarters in which there was at least one casualty and several wounded.  Since the riot, CDC Secretary General Acarous Gray has been on air making statements the Justice Ministry describes as ""inflammatory and unnecessary"".

"Fellow Liberia. Today's event at the CDC headquarter marks a sad event in our post war history as several young fellow Liberia woke up this morning, left their families, to participate in what was to be a peaceful rally. I lived near there, and saw the crowd gathering and parading in the front of my home chanting their various slogans in re not voting tomorrow. It is tragic for unarmed Liberia no matter the provocation, to loose their lives. I am sure the matter will be investigated and the facts should come eventually. However, this incidence is evident of a fragile peace we enjoy in Liberia, and our struggle to navigate the complexities of ""democracy."" I pray that our leaders, will step back take a deep look into themselves, and accept that we are all connected, one small family, only a few cousins removed, and that when the dust settle, we all still have to live in this our Liberia. The foundation of democracy is the element of compromise - winner does not always have to take all. It is the great compromises that strengthens the foundation of democracy. At the end of the day we all win when our leaders see it befitting to come to the table to sort things out peacefully in the interest of national unity and growth. Liberia has come along way in such a short time, but we have a long way to go. We can only get there through unity, peace and mutual respect for our diversity and differences. Whenever a young life is lost, a part of our future is lost. Whenever an elder is lost, a part of our history is lost. We must do more to care for those most vulnerable and show greater compassion for one another. The level of disrespect shown to one another in these times are not healthy for such a fragile democracy that has so much to loose. I hope the government will investigate this matter to ensure it does not happen again. We have a disenfranchised youth population - we know this is the region's problem. As we have seen with the Arab Spring, when you have too many young people who feel that our leaders government and non-government, are not working in their interest although they represent the majority, we have a problem. I often say to Liberia abroad - find the opportunity to pay someone tuition in Liberia. Help a young person. So many friends in Liberia are supporting the youth, employing them, paying their tuition, helping them - these folks are our unsung heroes. We all have to chip in and find a way to address this problem. At the end of the day, we are all a few cousins removed. I am proud to be a Liberia, but am sad that today saw the lost of the lives of young Liberia. In peace.","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 00:22:43","Axel Addy",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"It is sadden that we are engaging in activities that have the potential to undermine the fragile peace we currently enjoy without reflecting our most recent past. The gathering should have been peaceful as claimed by CDC but it turned violent when stones were threw from the crowd, shortly followed by the PoliceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reaction. So so sadden having viewed the pictures on the internet. Therefore, I would like to use this medium to appeal to the consciousness of all Liberia to refrain from all acts of violence and engage in constructive dialogue to mend our differences. There are always better alternatives, violence cannot resolve any problem, rather deepen the wounds, breed hatred and to a greater extend make us insensitive to the general well-being of society.
Chapter 1 Article 1 of the constitution reads: ""All power is inherent in the people. All free governments are instituted by their authority and for their benefit and they have the right to alter and reform the same when their safety and happiness so require. In order to ensure democratic government which responds to the wishes of the governed, the people shall have the right at such period, and in such manner as provided for under this constitution to cause their public servants to leave office and to fill vacancies by elections and appointments"". In my opinion, as provided for under the constitution, it is the right of all Liberia (18 + and properly registered electorate) to exercise their franchise in the electoral process. As such, under on condition should this right be denied or people be coaxed from exercising it. If for whatsoever reasons people are happy/unhappy with the current regime, simply vote ELLEN orWinstonTubman but remember to have Liberia at heart in making that decision, in terms of, who can transform the country, reconcile the people and make the country a better place for our children children...

Thinking about it seriously for hours now and have really not come to a logical conclusion on what the security officers meant by their indiscriminate shooting actions today. Granted the proposed rally or march was ill-legal and also that the Cdcians became violent to an extent, did it warrant shooting to hurt and kill in this manner? The government claimed there was exchange of gun fire between both parties, CDC and the security officers, but up to the time of the press conference, there was absolutely no information regarding injury to the security officers as a result of shooting from CDC's end. Heard from the Justice Minister that a stone thrown at one of the Nigerian officers led him to fire live bullet which from my judgement may have resulted to the death in question so far, could tear gas not have been the appropriate countering option in that situation?","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-08 01:07:23","Anderson Miamen",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"It's been quite a sad day in Liberia and it takes us all down memory lane. What actually surprises me about these riots are the fact the WinstonTubman is quoted as threatening to create a situation of condition of war if the run-off was not delay for a month. Day after that threat a supposed-to-be peace party rally ended up as a running battle with police and peacekeepers. I strongly feel Amb.WinstonTubman needs to be held responsible for Monday's riot and all the chaos that ensued. Incitement that leads to or engenders violence is a punishable crime. In 2005, when the CDC looked the leading political party and campaigned on indigenous lines,WinstonTubman threatened at a forum by the National Mandingo Caucus that any attempt to exclude his 'Congo' people would mean war. Amb.WinstonTubman unsuccessfully tried to denied the report, claiming he was not a man of violence. People change with times, and maybeWinstonTubman has changed for the worst. Can he answer to how and why the property of Kailondo was vandalized? What has the private citizens got to do with the electoral protest. I thinkWinstonTubman needs to be charged, tried and if guilty jailed at the Post Stockade, one of the relics left by his tyrannical uncle.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-08 01:27:42","Cheechiay Jablasone",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

What about those who incited the people to get in the streets? What about the stones and petrol  bombs that were being thrown at the police? The police is claiming there was a gun shot fired from among the protesters. It is so unfortunate that some life had to be loss during this episode. My heart goes out to the families of all those victimized in this incident. There is a need for an investigation and those who incited those people to get in the streets should not be left out. I strongly believe they knew this would have ended this way. So Benito, unless you allow your biases to cloud your judgement,  it  is The CDC to  blame for this and not PresidentEllenJohnsonSirleaf. they should have some answers for the Liberia people that they want to govern so badly....so badly that people have to die in a simple election just a day before exercising their God given right. what a shame!!!","Liberian Observer Facebook","2011-11-08 01:35:54","Isaac Harris",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"During the Liberia civil war, one of the many peace talks was arranged in Burkina Faso. Fearing deep acrimony and possible violence, the Burkinabe hosts separated the Liberia by factions and posted guards to keep them from each other. On the morning of the first day people recognized old friends they hadn't seen in years. Some of the had been classmates, school mates and in-laws. They were soon laughing, patting each other on the back and catching up as if they did not represent warring factions.  The guards proved superfluous - unnecessary. Here we are again. Regardless of our passion and politics, we share this bond. Some young Liberia(s) left home this morning to participate in a form of political expression. There is a Liberia mother (or mothers) second guessing her choices tonight and grieving over a child whose laughter she will never hear again. As a people we have paid such a steep price for the peace we have - today we overcharged ourselves. We were ripped off. Enough blood has been shed. While some may be more responsible than others - as Liberia we share a collective responsibility for the state of our body politic. It ought not to be like this.

Stop trying to misappropriate the actions of a few trigger happy Liberia Police officers as orders from the Commander in Chief. This exact behavior was sparked between the supporters of the opposition and ECOMOG six years ago when Ellen won that race against Weah, and today we witnessed it again. How about theWinstonTubman and Weah camp adhering to the countless warnings to refrain from inciting violence in their supporters or making erroneous statements about 'who will pay or what act of violence you or whoever intent to inflict on our president? It is statements like these that create such behaviors. Who suffers? The poor! In all honesty, you should be grateful to Ellen that you can now make such comments at the president and don't face any retribution. This is what democracy is all about.

"Statement by President Obama on the Presidential Elections in Liberia
 
The Liberia people will go to the polls tomorrow to elect the next President of Liberia.  This historic vote is an opportunity for Liberia to strengthen the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s democracy, and to deepen its peace, prosperity and national unity.  We encourage all voters of all political preferences to exercise their universal right to participate in the democratic process Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all Liberia should have the ability to exercise this right without fear of violence or intimidation. 
 
Liberia has taken important steps to consolidate its democracy since the end of its civil war.  Those gains must not be setback by individuals who seek to disrupt the political process.  The international community will hold accountable those who choose to obstruct the democratic process.  We encourage all security forces in Liberia to exercise maximum restraint and to allow peaceful protest.  And we commend all that international election observers, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the Liberia people are doing to ensure a free, fair, and peaceful run-off election.
 
The United States is deeply committed to its historic relationship with Liberia and its people.  We are also deeply committed to the strength of democracy on the African continent.  In that spirit, we will continue to strongly support the success of a peaceful democratic process for the Liberia people, and the peace and prosperity of Liberia.","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 04:04:32","Taa Wongbe",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Our Liberia story is weird and deep...it is a story within a story...it is a story wrapped in greed, misconception, division...it is a story such that if demystified in ways that the ordinary Liberia can digest and apply meaning to...if it is crystallised in a manner that people, upon surgically analysing and applying common sense/logic to (thereby inadvertently emancipating themselves from the claws of illusion and hypnosis) can be better suited to make the best of decisions...decisions that affect them directly or indirectly. 

An ill-informed society is sick; it is a society that is characteristically stranded between delusion and hopelessness. The result of an ill-informed and underserved society that is on the verge of crumbling under the whims of mission-driven ideologues was, again, witnessed today. A day of gloom and profound sense of apprehension best describes the unfoldings in the only place we've come to know as our home. Disturbing/graphic photos of Liberia drowned in their own blood have jammed my iPhone...not to mention those, for no justifiable reasons of their making, that lost their lives. Yet, there are those who have opted to make light of the situation. Thinkering around the edges of reality isn't the way forward.","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 04:16:01","Varney Clarke",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"Democracy does not have to be so sad
Joseph Saah Fallah

I am saddened by the news of the death of an ordinary Liberia citizen today. No matter our political persuasions, no Liberia citizen deserves to die under such circumstances -- it did not have to happen! 

While this is clearly not the time to play partisan politics, the awful incident of today should be a reminder to all Liberia that, although we have come a long way, after 14 dreadful years of senseless wars, we still have a far way to go in reconciling our differences, promoting peace, and abiding by the Laws of the Country.

 It is a complete paradox that, in the name of democracy, we are willing to invite anarchy -- in the name of democracy, we are willing to create enemies -- and in the name of democracy, we are willing to take our beloved Liberia 50 more years backwards -- as if more than 14 years of senseless fighting had not done enough damage. 

My brother and sisters, today is not a day for partisan politics -- it is one for personal reflection and introspection. Each Liberia must ask: what have I done or what am I doing to promote or perpetuate the lingering hatred -- the lingering division amongst our people? Oh, yes, we must ask ourselves and search deeply inward and find the answers -- and not only find the answers -- but we must commit ourselves to positive change! 

IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m reminded about a very unfortunate incident in the State of Arizona, about a year ago -- the incident in which U.S. Representative Giffords was shot and seriously injured and many of her staffs and ordinary citizens were fatally shot. I also remember that this incident occurred during a time of intense political bickering between Democrats and Republicans in Washington D.C. 

I can also remember that many Americans squarely placed the blame of the Arizona tragedy on the charged political atmosphere that existed in Washington D.C. during that time -- Congress vs. the White House -- Democrats vs. Republicans. And oh, many members of Congress also quickly recognized that the level of political bickering had reached all time high and needed to be tuned down -- unfortunately, it had to take the Arizona tragedy to pull the plug -- and maybe because the tragedy was too close to home! 

It is fair now to say that the political bickering in Washington D.C. that preceded the Arizona tragedy has been immensely reduced, although differences amongst politicians remained perfectly intact. I have particularly recognized that Sarah Palin, one of the politicians blamed for promoting the charged political environment that may have contributed to the Arizona tragedy, primarily for her fiery political rhetoric, has been conspicuously absent from the political scene since then. Many pundits have speculated that Sarah PalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political career has been greatly harmed by the Arizona tragedy  

In my opinion, these politicians have done the right thing -- tuning down the rhetoric -- not because they are weak -- but because they are strong. They have come to the recognition that intense political bickering and fiery political rhetoric may just lead an already confused person to engage in behaviors that produce unfortunate results. Consequently, it makes sense to be mindful of our political commentaries -- paying close attention to our local political context. These are times when our pens and our speeches can be even more powerful and deadly than the guns that may have been used today! 

My prayer is that God will console the families whose loved one is gone from amongst us. Let today be your day of decision making -- choose your path: living in peace and harmony or in insecurity and discord!    

Let not our compatriotsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ die in vain! Peace to all!","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 04:22:16","Joseph Saah Fallah",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"Statement by President Obama on the Presidential Elections in Liberia
 
The Liberia people will go to the polls tomorrow to elect the next President of Liberia.  This historic vote is an opportunity for Liberia to strengthen the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s democracy, and to deepen its peace, prosperity and national unity.  We encourage all voters of all political preferences to exercise their universal right to participate in the democratic process Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all Liberia should have the ability to exercise this right without fear of violence or intimidation. 
 
Liberia has taken important steps to consolidate its democracy since the end of its civil war.  Those gains must not be setback by individuals who seek to disrupt the political process.  The international community will hold accountable those who choose to obstruct the democratic process.  We encourage all security forces in Liberia to exercise maximum restraint and to allow peaceful protest.  And we commend all that international election observers, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the Liberia people are doing to ensure a free, fair, and peaceful run-off election.
 
The United States is deeply committed to its historic relationship with Liberia and its people.  We are also deeply committed to the strength of democracy on the African continent.  In that spirit, we will continue to strongly support the success of a peaceful democratic process for the Liberia people, and the peace and prosperity of Liberia.","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 04:04:32","Taa Wongbe",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

You don't have a peaceful protest by throwing rocks at police officers and using other objects to block roads!! You don't expect a peacef...ul protest when a protester is trying to disarm a police officer who has the right to carry a gun... So if any statement should've been made, it should've come directly from the head of the CDC party, Mr.WinstonTubman, strongly denouncing these kinds of rebel style protest!!!

"Acarous Gray: BLOODAY MONDAY has shocked too many lovers of justice, especially when the elite unite of the Liberia police opened automatic gun firing at unarmed civilians, killing more than four persons and wounding many others while UNMIL FORCES fought to stop them.WinstonTubman and Weah almost got killed while the personal vehile of Amb.WinstonTubman was shot at with bullet mark still on it. It was a mournful moment as a pregnant women got killed by the police who used the back of President Sileaf home to enter the beach and killed others who were escaping the scene.The partisans who forced Amb.WinstonTubman to enter the vehicle immediately took the bullet in his head, a bullet that could end the life story of Amb.WinstonTubman.Currently three TV and radio stations are being closed by the Government while onLY pro-government stations are operating. Evidence of police brutality and deadly force was consistantly shown on one of the TV stations called POWER TV, while the other two permitted callers to aired their views.At POWER TV riot police forcefully enter the main studio room to destroy evidence but the video tape is already in wide spread circulation. Opposition leader and Presidential candidate Dr. Cecelia Ndebe was also arrested by the police and later released, while the NDC Presidential candidate Amb. Dew Maison was caught up in the shoot out to kill on the grounds of the CDC. THE FACT WILL NEVER HIDE.","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 05:27:45","Laura Wilson",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

In as much as it is sad for any Liberia to lose their life, I am shock that some Liberia are still willing to put themselves in harmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way for rogue politicians. After fighting senselessly for 14 years, and leaving some of these same individuals amputated, while several others are now forgotten, I find it pathetic that some have not learn their lesson. Visit Liberia and you will see people fighting on every street corners. Even in the US, we are uncontrollable. These are some of the aftermath of a senseless civil war. CDC knew this was coming.

This is the difference between UPians and CDCians. No matter how we love our standard-bearer, there is no way she is going to send us in the streets for a futile cause. Some brand us as blind loyalist, which I find laughable. At least almost every UPian knows why they support UP or have some knowledge of what the Unity Party stands for; unlike the CDCians. I am yet to see a CDCians who can emphatically state CDCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s position is social political issues. This party clearly does not have a platform but some still see them as a feasible alternative to the UP led administration. Now tell me who is the BLIND LOYALIST?

"In difficult times like these, sober reflexions and tolerance are indisputable imperatives to the maintenance of peace and tranquillity. The need for mutual respect cannot also be overemphasised. It is in recognition of these facts that I am tempted to comment on the latest riot/demonstration which according to Reuters has resulted in the lost of at least one life.

I am not concerned about whatever inquest that will take place hereinafter to establish the cause(s) of the riot/demonstration as I do not have all the facts. However, based on my personal experiences of complexion of this nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s historical and political intricacies I can offer a comment without passing judgement on any particular person or organisation because I am not privy to all the facts. I therefore prefer to generalise in my contribution to the issue.

As a nation and a people, irrespective of religious, ethnic, ideological and or political orientation, we are indivisible Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at least thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what we were taught. This is why the demise of one Liberia diminishes me and I tend to think that it also diminishes many other Liberia. 

All of a certain what we had hope would have been a peaceful elections have claimed the lives of several compatriots of ours. Democracy does not have to be violent and so quite unfortunately, the signs on the wall of time do not make good reading. We have again demonstrated to the world that we are incapable of holding our own in the comity of civilised nations when challenged to the battle of ideas. 

Because that what democracy is: being able to sell big ideas to the electorates and by so doing win their votes. And there is so much to sell to the people of Liberia and get elected. For example: 
1. Liberia is the only West African costal country that does not meet the EU third party import standard of seafood and molluscs.
2. Funds generated from the National Social Security and Welfare Corporation  are not being used to address homelessness neither is the National Housing Corporation has any meaning to the ordinary citizen
3. Liberia has never fulfil its allotted quota for the importation of selected fruits into the EU under the Lome Convention
4. There is no proven strategic agriculture programme to meet domestic food production neither is there any to take advantage of the vast  regional and global market opportunities that exist
5. Liberia no longer exports palm kernel as it did before the 1980s though that market is bigger today than at any time in history.

These are job creating, income and revenues generating opportunities that could bring in billions of dollars to the economy but not being exploited neither to say that the list is not exhausted. So there are big issues that could win elections and many flaws of the government that could be exploited. But all we hear is about personality, hate, threats and the other gutter politics from either side.

Rather than subscribing to brand of politics which has moulded the thinking of supporters, those seeking power could have done better by focusing on some big issues to win the vote of the people. Our trademark politics of hate, fear, violence and division is just unhelpful for national unity, peace and progress. It can only degenerate our democratic process to anarchy. More than most, we know the consequences of replacing democracy and the rule of law with violence and therefore need no reminding. No more Liberia man or woman, boy or girl deserves to lose his/her life in the name of democracy.  

This is why news that at least one of our fellow compatriots was killed by the police and alleged threat from the CDC to boycott the run off elections is unfortunate. There is no justification for the police to use live bullet on anybody. Leaders from various parties, especially CDC and UP, failed to diffuse tension from the onset when they chose to nickname one another derogatorily Ã¢â‚¬ËœMonkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœBaboonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.  But like many such incidents before, the story tend to twirl in endless narratives. This was meant to be a simple, peaceful democratic process designed to elect our leaders. It is therefore a betrayal not only of the aspirations of the Liberia people but also the wishes of our founding fathers. All the people desire of their leaders is a peaceful prosperous nation in which they can live and bequeath to their children and the unborn generations. This cannot be too much to ask. On the other hand, our founding fathers wishes could not have been simpler: They sought to evince to the world that the Blackman too is capable of democratic self governance and compliance to the rule of law, hence the establishment of the nation state.

When we Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially those vying for power and or in position of trust Ã¢â‚¬â€œ fall short of upholding these aspirations, an written covenant with posterity, the living and the unborn is broken. Our leaders must take the moral high grounds by leading by examples. However, when the presidency of the republic of Liberia is won at the expense of the tears, blood and lives of Liberia, then the moral high grounds are lost because the presidency does not worth any Liberia life. 

In a bizarre way we are very efficient at making things difficult for ourselves and others. We have allowed a common democratic process to claim at least a valuable life. This situation was entirely avoidable but for the lack of mutual trust, respect and tolerance among politicians which has adversely infected their followers. This is a failure of leadership. So as the costs from this violent episode are being counted and the inquest begun, common sense demands that we all stay shy exacerbating the tension by exercising restraint and eschew the easy option of jumping to knee jerk reactions.  Zealousness motivated by sycophancy, politics and ideology in difficult times like these run the risk of being antidotes to national unity and peace. Hence, resisting the temptations of bitterness and hate is our challenge to overcome by clinging on to the bonds of nationalism and justice.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-08 06:06:24","Fitzgerald Vinton",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"I will say this today, tomorrow, and any other day. Yesterday again and again, words were thrown out to people to get on the street to protest (demonstrate). What are we demonstrating for? At what cost are we demonstrating? Will it bring goods into our lives? Will it make better things to happen to us? The answer is so much NO. This is the work of the devil. Real work of the devil I tell you. The only reason why these things happen and continue to happen is because we worship political leaders and men with money. We throw out ourselves into the street to sell our souls for these people. We give out our children to these people. Who is Ellen, George orWinstonTubman? They are people like you and me. The only difference is that at one point in time, God smile with them and blessed them. Who are they to tell you to go and died for them? Is it because we do not know where we come from? Where we are going? What we stand for? We forget things too fast. Let us all concentrate very well. Let us be focus. What we do today may have great impact on our lives and lives of our children.  Let us come together and be one. Let us learn to love and share the goodness of God. 
Let me be frank and tell people. Prices will never go down unless God wants it to go down. The world population is increasing everyday with many more mouths to be fed. Poverty is increasing all around us. Lot of things is bound to happen so let us be careful. 
Ellen is not my mother. We talked today and tomorrow and everyday creating Ellen over and over and again. Liberia created Ellen. They made Ellen. They went out to look for her. They yawn for her help.  Today, people sit and listen to the devil and say Ã¢â‚¬Å“She is a warlordÃ¢â‚¬Â. Two Sundays ago, Prophet T. B. Joshua, spoke on words being used by other against their friends and said that if we called a person by a word or name, we should be careful because that name may come upon us also. Who can tell me the difference between what Charles Taylor did and what happen yesterday? ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the act of Rebellion. What were they rebelling for? What do they want? Where are they coming from? Where are they going? Be careful Liberia. Be very careful. We believe we know all and yet we know nothing.  
During the olden days, it was not bullet that was used to killed man. They stoned a man death. They used rocks and stoned him to death.  Modern days developed bullet because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faster and quicker yet can also be as long as it wants you to feel the pain. 
See George Weah. He was blessed to be a footballer. Why are you pushing him to be something else? We are also creating Ã¢â‚¬Å“a different Geroge WeahÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Where is WinstonTubman coming from? Again I say, if he could not save the lives of those students that were killed and raped by the Doe Government then what can he do now? Be careful Liberia because what a man has done before he can also do again and will always do again. Let us learn to love and share. Please Liberia. Please.","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 08:08:25","Patrick Satia",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"They had it all carved out of Allen White play book, with camera ready to take pictures of the results. In as much as it is sad for any Liberia to lose their life, I am shock that some Liberia are still willing to put themselves in harmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way for rogue politicians. After fighting senselessly for 14 years, and leaving some of these same individuals amputated, while several others are now forgotten, I find it pathetic that some have not learn their lesson. Visit Liberia and you will see people fighting on every street corners. Even in the US, we are uncontrollable. These are some of the aftermath of a senseless civil war. CDC knew this was coming.

This is the difference between UPians and CDCians. No matter how we love our standard-bearer, there is no way she is going to send us in the streets for a futile cause. Some brand us as blind loyalist, which I find laughable. At least almost every UPian knows why they support UP or have some knowledge of what the Unity Party stands for; unlike the CDCians. I am yet to see a CDCians who can emphatically state CDCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s position is social political issues. This party clearly does not have a platform but some still see them as a feasible alternative to the UP led administration. Now tell me who is the BLIND LOYALIST?

"In difficult times like these, sober reflexions and tolerance are indisputable imperatives to the maintenance of peace and tranquillity. The need for mutual respect cannot also be overemphasised. It is in recognition of these facts that I am tempted to comment on the latest riot/demonstration which according to Reuters has resulted in the lost of at least one life.

I am not concerned about whatever inquest that will take place hereinafter to establish the cause(s) of the riot/demonstration as I do not have all the facts. However, based on my personal experiences of complexion of this nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s historical and political intricacies I can offer a comment without passing judgement on any particular person or organisation because I am not privy to all the facts. I therefore prefer to generalise in my contribution to the issue.

As a nation and a people, irrespective of religious, ethnic, ideological and or political orientation, we are indivisible Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at least thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what we were taught. This is why the demise of one Liberia diminishes me and I tend to think that it also diminishes many other Liberia. 

All of a certain what we had hope would have been a peaceful elections have claimed the lives of several compatriots of ours. Democracy does not have to be violent and so quite unfortunately, the signs on the wall of time do not make good reading. We have again demonstrated to the world that we are incapable of holding our own in the comity of civilised nations when challenged to the battle of ideas. 

Because that what democracy is: being able to sell big ideas to the electorates and by so doing win their votes. And there is so much to sell to the people of Liberia and get elected. For example: 
1. Liberia is the only West African costal country that does not meet the EU third party import standard of seafood and molluscs.
2. Funds generated from the National Social Security and Welfare Corporation  are not being used to address homelessness neither is the National Housing Corporation has any meaning to the ordinary citizen
3. Liberia has never fulfil its allotted quota for the importation of selected fruits into the EU under the Lome Convention
4. There is no proven strategic agriculture programme to meet domestic food production neither is there any to take advantage of the vast  regional and global market opportunities that exist
5. Liberia no longer exports palm kernel as it did before the 1980s though that market is bigger today than at any time in history.

These are job creating, income and revenues generating opportunities that could bring in billions of dollars to the economy but not being exploited neither to say that the list is not exhausted. So there are big issues that could win elections and many flaws of the government that could be exploited. But all we hear is about personality, hate, threats and the other gutter politics from either side.

Rather than subscribing to brand of politics which has moulded the thinking of supporters, those seeking power could have done better by focusing on some big issues to win the vote of the people. Our trademark politics of hate, fear, violence and division is just unhelpful for national unity, peace and progress. It can only degenerate our democratic process to anarchy. More than most, we know the consequences of replacing democracy and the rule of law with violence and therefore need no reminding. No more Liberia man or woman, boy or girl deserves to lose his/her life in the name of democracy.  

This is why news that at least one of our fellow compatriots was killed by the police and alleged threat from the CDC to boycott the run off elections is unfortunate. There is no justification for the police to use live bullet on anybody. Leaders from various parties, especially CDC and UP, failed to diffuse tension from the onset when they chose to nickname one another derogatorily Ã¢â‚¬ËœMonkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœBaboonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.  But like many such incidents before, the story tend to twirl in endless narratives. This was meant to be a simple, peaceful democratic process designed to elect our leaders. It is therefore a betrayal not only of the aspirations of the Liberia people but also the wishes of our founding fathers. All the people desire of their leaders is a peaceful prosperous nation in which they can live and bequeath to their children and the unborn generations. This cannot be too much to ask. On the other hand, our founding fathers wishes could not have been simpler: They sought to evince to the world that the Blackman too is capable of democratic self governance and compliance to the rule of law, hence the establishment of the nation state.

When we Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially those vying for power and or in position of trust Ã¢â‚¬â€œ fall short of upholding these aspirations, an written covenant with posterity, the living and the unborn is broken. Our leaders must take the moral high grounds by leading by examples. However, when the presidency of the republic of Liberia is won at the expense of the tears, blood and lives of Liberia, then the moral high grounds are lost because the presidency does not worth any Liberia life. 

In a bizarre way we are very efficient at making things difficult for ourselves and others. We have allowed a common democratic process to claim at least a valuable life. This situation was entirely avoidable but for the lack of mutual trust, respect and tolerance among politicians which has adversely infected their followers. This is a failure of leadership. So as the costs from this violent episode are being counted and the inquest begun, common sense demands that we all stay shy exacerbating the tension by exercising restraint and eschew the easy option of jumping to knee jerk reactions.  Zealousness motivated by sycophancy, politics and ideology in difficult times like these run the risk of being antidotes to national unity and peace. Hence, resisting the temptations of bitterness and hate is our challenge to overcome by clinging on to the bonds of nationalism and justice.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-08 06:06:24","Fitzgerald Vinton",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"just curious about your views on this:  A CDC member who just won a representative seat during the 1st round of elections sent this... what are your thoughts:  
""Hello my dear friends, I am so worried! Is this how we will live in Liberia? I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe I was stopped from boarding the plane today. I was travelling to Ghana on the Kenya Airways 5pm flight but to my absolute disappointment, my right to free movement was abused. I say this to say, I was told by one Mr. Forkpah an officer of the Bureau of Immigration that the Minister of Justice Cllr. Christina Tah has ordered my arrest and that I Munah E. Pelham is wanted and so I cannot leave the country. My dear Liberia, my passport was taken away from me and I was not allowed on board the plane. When I asked Ã¢â‚¬Å“why am I wanted?Ã¢â‚¬Â The officer said it was an order that no one from CDC (my political Party) should leave the country. My reply was why? But no answer. He later said, I should call some top government security officials if I really want to leave. So I did. I was able to talk to the Defense Minister, Commissioner Williams of Immigration, Minister Piah of the Ministry of Information and many others in authority not forgetting the Immigration Commissioner himself Hon. Massaquoi who I called almost 30 times but he refused to answer me. I tried so hard to find out what was going on and why I was not allowed to leave the country but none of them could tell me. When I asked to get my passport back, Mr. Forkpah the immigration officer told me to pick it up from the Ministry of Justice. So I returned to Monrovia without my passport. Now what next? Is this how we are going to lead our people? Can someone please advice...............cuz I certainly want to talk to my Lawyer about issues like, My ticket fares, hotel bill that was paid in Ghana, other expenses in getting ready for this all important business trip.""","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 08:48:13","Barkue Tubman",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

""Hello my dear friends, I am so worried! Is this how we will live in Liberia? I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe I was stopped from boarding the plane today. I was travelling to Ghana on the Kenya Airways 5pm flight but to my absolute disappointment, my right to free movement was abused. I say this to say, I was told by one Mr. Forkpah an officer of the Bureau of Immigration that the Minister of Justice Cllr. Christina Tah has ordered my arrest and that I Munah E. Pelham is wanted and so I cannot leave the country. My dear Liberia, my passport was taken away from me and I was not allowed on board the plane. When I asked Ã¢â‚¬Å“why am I wanted?Ã¢â‚¬Â The officer said it was an order that no one from CDC (my political Party) should leave the country. My reply was why? But no answer. He later said, I should call some top government security officials if I really want to leave. So I did. I was able to talk to the Defense Minister, Commissioner Williams of Immigration, Minister Piah of the Ministry of Information and many others in authority not forgetting the Immigration Commissioner himself Hon. Massaquoi who I called almost 30 times but he refused to answer me. I tried so hard to find out what was going on and why I was not allowed to leave the country but none of them could tell me. When I asked to get my passport back, Mr. Forkpah the immigration officer told me to pick it up from the Ministry of Justice. So I returned to Monrovia without my passport. Now what next? Is this how we are going to lead our people? Can someone please advice...............cuz I certainly want to talk to my Lawyer about issues like, My ticket fares, hotel bill that was paid in Ghana, other expenses in getting ready for this all important business trip.""","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 08:48:13","Barkue Tubman",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

""Hello my dear friends, I am so worried! Is this how we will live in Liberia? I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe I was stopped from boarding the plane today. I was travelling to Ghana on the Kenya Airways 5pm flight but to my absolute disappointment, my right to free movement was abused. I say this to say, I was told by one Mr. Forkpah an officer of the Bureau of Immigration that the Minister of Justice Cllr. Christina Tah has ordered my arrest and that I Munah E. Pelham is wanted and so I cannot leave the country. My dear Liberia, my passport was taken away from me and I was not allowed on board the plane. When I asked Ã¢â‚¬Å“why am I wanted?Ã¢â‚¬Â The officer said it was an order that no one from CDC (my political Party) should leave the country. My reply was why? But no answer. He later said, I should call some top government security officials if I really want to leave. So I did. I was able to talk to the Defense Minister, Commissioner Williams of Immigration, Minister Piah of the Ministry of Information and many others in authority not forgetting the Immigration Commissioner himself Hon. Massaquoi who I called almost 30 times but he refused to answer me. I tried so hard to find out what was going on and why I was not allowed to leave the country but none of them could tell me. When I asked to get my passport back, Mr. Forkpah the immigration officer told me to pick it up from the Ministry of Justice. So I returned to Monrovia without my passport. Now what next? Is this how we are going to lead our people?

"All the ringleaders and the so called messengers of boycotting need to be arrested.  TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been threatening people all week, telling us not to go out, and if we do something will happen.  They had no intentions to march yesterday.  Many of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“ringleadersÃ¢â‚¬Â were home or about, and nowhere near CDC headquarters, where there incident took place.  They wanted to cause this madness in hopes that the election wouldn't happen today.  This has been their strategy all along.  I hope the government and the international community take this seriously by arresting and prosecuting the ones who plan the march without obtaining a permit.  Liberia has LAWS!  We are governed by a Constitution.  Why would any sensible person decide to organize a Ã¢â‚¬Å“marchÃ¢â‚¬Â without a permit?  One day prior to a runoff they are boycotting?  Because of the hunger for power by a few, a young man is dead!!!

"just curious about your views on this:  A CDC member who just won a representative seat during the 1st round of elections sent this... what are your thoughts:  
""Hello my dear friends, I am so worried! Is this how we will live in Liberia? I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe I was stopped from boarding the plane today. I was travelling to Ghana on the Kenya Airways 5pm flight but to my absolute disappointment, my right to free movement was abused. I say this to say, I was told by one Mr. Forkpah an officer of the Bureau of Immigration that the Minister of Justice Cllr. Christina Tah has ordered my arrest and that I Munah E. Pelham is wanted and so I cannot leave the country. My dear Liberia, my passport was taken away from me and I was not allowed on board the plane. When I asked Ã¢â‚¬Å“why am I wanted?Ã¢â‚¬Â The officer said it was an order that no one from CDC (my political Party) should leave the country. My reply was why? But no answer. He later said, I should call some top government security officials if I really want to leave. So I did. I was able to talk to the Defense Minister, Commissioner Williams of Immigration, Minister Piah of the Ministry of Information and many others in authority not forgetting the Immigration Commissioner himself Hon. Massaquoi who I called almost 30 times but he refused to answer me. I tried so hard to find out what was going on and why I was not allowed to leave the country but none of them could tell me. When I asked to get my passport back, Mr. Forkpah the immigration officer told me to pick it up from the Ministry of Justice. So I returned to Monrovia without my passport. Now what next? Is this how we are going to lead our people? Can someone please advice...............cuz I certainly want to talk to my Lawyer about issues like, My ticket fares, hotel bill that was paid in Ghana, other expenses in getting ready for this all important business trip.""","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 08:48:13","Barkue Tubman",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"Certainly Michael, it is disappointing that some people want to take the country back to the dark days. From all indications, CDC cannot win the run off elections so they have chosen the most cowardly path imaginable. The party's failure to land the support of Prince Johnson and Charles Brumskin was a major blow. It is just ridiculous to hold the entire country hostage and try once more to paint a black image of the country especially when there have been frantic efforts at reclaiming the lost image of the country. It is just sad. The government must be strong enough now to prosecute those behind the chaos that erupted in the country on Monday. Who will CDC believe? In my opinion, the party will accept only results announced by her which is impossible under these circumstances. I pity Liberia as a nation.

"Actually Rob Dorley, as a Liberia who happens to be a lawyer and lives in the US right now, I can assure that the authorities would do the same, if not more, in the US. Usually, they even get a warrant to search one's home, job, etc. Here, individuals are routinely arrested for threats against the Pres., and against public safety. Freedom of speech/movement is NOT an absolute right in that the state has a greater interest/responsibility, in maintaining order and civility.Arrests are made for having no permits, individuals beaten, etc. (ie, some of current problems with the Occupy Wall Street mov't or previous civil rights demonstrations).Police brutality, esp. against minorities, is as common as the sunrise in most urban areas, especially against black men. When you put the events in Liberia into context, wherein you have leaders on the air making inflammatory/misleading statements that could incite riots or disturb the peace, the gov't can ask the courts for permission to temporarily shut down those media outlets to prevent unrest, until order is restored. No one in the US can go on nat'l radio, especially the night before the presidential elections, and say anything that could intimidate the public from voting or suggest that the gov't is against the populace. Are you kidding me? The FBI would be at their door in a minute. And yes, airports and bus terminals would be alerted once a warrant is gotten. Gov'ts learned this the hard way from the Rwanda example. So don't let the textbooks romanticize democracy as giving absolute rights. By the way, you do realize the US still executes people and has not been a signatory to some torture conventions, etc.","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 11:34:05","Bindu Padmore Wotorson",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

""Hello my dear friends, I am so worried! Is this how we will live in Liberia? I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe I was stopped from boarding the plane today. I was travelling to Ghana on the Kenya Airways 5pm flight but to my absolute disappointment, my right to free movement was abused. I say this to say, I was told by one Mr. Forkpah an officer of the Bureau of Immigration that the Minister of Justice Cllr. Christina Tah has ordered my arrest and that I Munah E. Pelham is wanted and so I cannot leave the country. My dear Liberia, my passport was taken away from me and I was not allowed on board the plane. When I asked Ã¢â‚¬Å“why am I wanted?Ã¢â‚¬Â The officer said it was an order that no one from CDC (my political Party) should leave the country. My reply was why? But no answer. He later said, I should call some top government security officials if I really want to leave. So I did. I was able to talk to the Defense Minister, Commissioner Williams of Immigration, Minister Piah of the Ministry of Information and many others in authority not forgetting the Immigration Commissioner himself Hon. Massaquoi who I called almost 30 times but he refused to answer me. I tried so hard to find out what was going on and why I was not allowed to leave the country but none of them could tell me.

"just curious about your views on this:  A CDC member who just won a representative seat during the 1st round of elections sent this... what are your thoughts:  
""Hello my dear friends, I am so worried! Is this how we will live in Liberia? I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe I was stopped from boarding the plane today. I was travelling to Ghana on the Kenya Airways 5pm flight but to my absolute disappointment, my right to free movement was abused. I say this to say, I was told by one Mr. Forkpah an officer of the Bureau of Immigration that the Minister of Justice Cllr. Christina Tah has ordered my arrest and that I Munah E. Pelham is wanted and so I cannot leave the country. My dear Liberia, my passport was taken away from me and I was not allowed on board the plane. When I asked Ã¢â‚¬Å“why am I wanted?Ã¢â‚¬Â The officer said it was an order that no one from CDC (my political Party) should leave the country. My reply was why? But no answer. He later said, I should call some top government security officials if I really want to leave. So I did. I was able to talk to the Defense Minister, Commissioner Williams of Immigration, Minister Piah of the Ministry of Information and many others in authority not forgetting the Immigration Commissioner himself Hon. Massaquoi who I called almost 30 times but he refused to answer me. I tried so hard to find out what was going on and why I was not allowed to leave the country but none of them could tell me. When I asked to get my passport back, Mr. Forkpah the immigration officer told me to pick it up from the Ministry of Justice. So I returned to Monrovia without my passport. Now what next? Is this how we are going to lead our people? Can someone please advice...............cuz I certainly want to talk to my Lawyer about issues like, My ticket fares, hotel bill that was paid in Ghana, other expenses in getting ready for this all important business trip.""","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 08:48:13","Barkue Tubman",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Liberia is gradually returning to its ugly past and nobody seems to care. Almost everybody is adoring this undemocratic act by theEllenJohnsonSirleaf administration without considering the corresponding consequences. Only dictators can muscle the press and shut independent radio stations. The other day ellen sacked LBS boss becasue he allowed an opposition to hold alive press conference on the state radio. Today, ellen has shut down three independent radio stations. I have always argued that Liberia did no go to war because there was no light, water, better living, etc. The same things that are now creeping were responsible for our civil war.

"Offie, c'mon we're going through an analysis about what the LAW should/shouldn't allow. We're discussing media censorship...that's a basic element of freedom of speech in Liberia. That's part of the Liberia constitution--the same constitution modeled after the US (three branches of gov't, etc. just like that democracy). So to deny that is to not acknowledge on what principles your country was founded. You can rarely find two exact situations in history (US vote boycott) but you do have similar lessons/precedent and that's what makes this discussion focus less on the exact facts but on the past lessons learned and the law relating to freedom of speech. In the past, in Liberia, like during the Doe years, warrants often weren't first gotten. And in the US, there was a time in the 1800's- early 1900's, the same issues occurred. Over time, the rule of law was respected. So when I see that court orders are first gotten in Liberia, in accordance with Liberia law, that's huge...more progress than young Liberia may realize. And btw, the US is often compared to England, France,etc. Most of those are actually socialist gov'ts but the right to vote is extremely cherished in those socieities. Yes, nations are sovereign but none exists in a bubble so when you're trying to develop yours, you have to explore what works best in other societies and what parts of those societies you'll emulate and what parts you won't based on your own national priorities/culture.","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 13:33:41","Bindu Padmore Wotorson",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"Fellow Liberia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I believe that, regardless of our differences in opinion on who the next President of our country should be, we all would agree that the happenings of yesterday was (1) very saddening, (2) puts a mark on this country that we do not want, and (3) stemmed from issues far greater than the elections itself. Now, we can go on and on about the perceived fraud, or lack thereof, of the elections process, but is that REALLY the issue??? I, for one, believe that that there are much greater underlying issues. Although, the elections are the central point of this forum, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to put that aside for just a minute. Is it conceivable that we could all, as Liberia, focus on the actual ISSUES that we have with the Government. In doing so, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s keep a couple of real facts in mind. (1) Elections are being held today (2)The results of the elections will be announced (3) The winner will be inaugurated as President in January and (4) The President will be the only leader of this country (unless we are hell bent on destruction).

For anyone who disagrees with these facts, you should probably stop reading now because this exercise is not going to help you or any of us.

""Hello my dear friends, I am so worried! Is this how we will live in Liberia? I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe I was stopped from boarding the plane today. I was travelling to Ghana on the Kenya Airways 5pm flight but to my absolute disappointment, my right to free movement was abused. I say this to say, I was told by one Mr. Forkpah an officer of the Bureau of Immigration that the Minister of Justice Cllr. Christina Tah has ordered my arrest and that I Munah E. Pelham is wanted and so I cannot leave the country. My dear Liberia, my passport was taken away from me and I was not allowed on board the plane. When I asked Ã¢â‚¬Å“why am I wanted?Ã¢â‚¬Â The officer said it was an order that no one from CDC (my political Party) should leave the country. My reply was why? But no answer. He later said, I should call some top government security officials if I really want to leave. So I did. I was able to talk to the Defense Minister, Commissioner Williams of Immigration, Minister Piah of the Ministry of Information and many others in authority not forgetting the Immigration Commissioner himself Hon. Massaquoi who I called almost 30 times but he refused to answer me. I tried so hard to find out what was going on and why I was not allowed to leave the country but none of them could tell me. When I asked to get my passport back, Mr. Forkpah the immigration officer told me to pick it up from the Ministry of Justice. So I returned to Monrovia without my passport. Now what next? Is this how we are going to lead our people? Can someone please advice...............cuz I certainly want to talk to my Lawyer about issues like, My ticket fares, hotel bill that was paid in Ghana, other expenses in getting ready for this all important business trip.""","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 08:48:13","Barkue Tubman",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"Eric, Are you a reporter or a politician? You can't have it both ways. To be an objective reporter, your report has to be even handed. Do you want Liberia to descend into lawlessness? If you cry out fire in a crowded cinema, whereby there is no fire, what are you trying to do? Please be careful what you print, otherwise you will surely be accountable for your actions at some point in time. Why were those three Radio stations, shut down by the authorities? The masses of the people will like to know. From my point of view, it seems like your report is bias and very insightful, the way it's being presented. Be a peace maker, not an advocate of war. May the almighty God guide our nation from going down the path, of destruction again.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-08 14:23:29","Momolu Sirleaf",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"E BillWinstonTubman, I'd hope that your gift doesn't stop at recognizing ""google lawyers"". You're not supposed to make sweeping statements about things you barely understand. Even UNMIL which had police officers deployed on the scene has not issued a definitive statement about what transpired. There were reports that gunfire came from the fence. We don't know if it is true. There are eyewitness reports that somebody other than the police fired at least three shots on the hill overlooking the party headquarters. None of this is verified. It is therefore strange, non-google lawyer that you are, you would be making claims about violated rights on the eve of the election. On Saturday the President gave a speech calling the 'boycott"" unconstitutional. On Monday the NEC issued a statement saying there was no statutory or legal provision for a political party to withdraw from the process at this point - making any such withdrawal illegal. I didn't see one post from you about the constitutionality. All of a sudden you've become a non-google constitutional lawyer. Please.","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 14:40:10","W.

""Hello my dear friends, I am so worried! Is this how we will live in Liberia? I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe I was stopped from boarding the plane today. I was travelling to Ghana on the Kenya Airways 5pm flight but to my absolute disappointment, my right to free movement was abused. I say this to say, I was told by one Mr. Forkpah an officer of the Bureau of Immigration that the Minister of Justice Cllr. Christina Tah has ordered my arrest and that I Munah E. Pelham is wanted and so I cannot leave the country. My dear Liberia, my passport was taken away from me and I was not allowed on board the plane. When I asked Ã¢â‚¬Å“why am I wanted?Ã¢â‚¬Â The officer said it was an order that no one from CDC (my political Party) should leave the country. My reply was why? But no answer. He later said, I should call some top government security officials if I really want to leave. So I did. I was able to talk to the Defense Minister, Commissioner Williams of Immigration, Minister Piah of the Ministry of Information and many others in authority not forgetting the Immigration Commissioner himself Hon. Massaquoi who I called almost 30 times but he refused to answer me. I tried so hard to find out what was going on and why I was not allowed to leave the country but none of them could tell me. When I asked to get my passport back, Mr. Forkpah the immigration officer told me to pick it up from the Ministry of Justice. So I returned to Monrovia without my passport. Now what next? Is this how we are going to lead our people? Can someone please advice...............cuz I certainly want to talk to my Lawyer about issues like, My ticket fares, hotel bill that was paid in Ghana, other expenses in getting ready for this all important business trip.""","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 08:48:13","Barkue Tubman",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

In that same period a prominent member of that party attempts to board a plane and depart the country. It does not appear entirely unreasonable for such travel to be put on hold.

""Hello my dear friends, I am so worried! Is this how we will live in Liberia? I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe I was stopped from boarding the plane today. I was travelling to Ghana on the Kenya Airways 5pm flight but to my absolute disappointment, my right to free movement was abused. I say this to say, I was told by one Mr. Forkpah an officer of the Bureau of Immigration that the Minister of Justice Cllr. Christina Tah has ordered my arrest and that I Munah E. Pelham is wanted and so I cannot leave the country. My dear Liberia, my passport was taken away from me and I was not allowed on board the plane. When I asked Ã¢â‚¬Å“why am I wanted?Ã¢â‚¬Â The officer said it was an order that no one from CDC (my political Party) should leave the country. My reply was why? But no answer. He later said, I should call some top government security officials if I really want to leave. So I did. I was able to talk to the Defense Minister, Commissioner Williams of Immigration, Minister Piah of the Ministry of Information and many others in authority not forgetting the Immigration Commissioner himself Hon. Massaquoi who I called almost 30 times but he refused to answer me. I tried so hard to find out what was going on and why I was not allowed to leave the country but none of them could tell me. When I asked to get my passport back, Mr. Forkpah the immigration officer told me to pick it up from the Ministry of Justice. So I returned to Monrovia without my passport. Now what next? Is this how we are going to lead our people? Can someone please advice...............cuz I certainly want to talk to my Lawyer about issues like, My ticket fares, hotel bill that was paid in Ghana, other expenses in getting ready for this all important business trip.""","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 08:48:13","Barkue Tubman",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
"wait, wait...hold on, lets be fair.  not all members of CDC are evil people out to destroy Liberia.  I think we have to take that notion from our minds that if somebody is a member of CDC they must be evil, ignorant and not capable of being patriotic citizens. Its the same as saying everybody from the Middle East must be terrorists.  As far as I know, Liberia has not declared a state of emergency, nor has the government announced that all leaders of CDC are wanted for questioning, nor has their been an announcement made that travel of CDC members are banned.   The best intentions of a government comes into question when it starts to look like things are being done under cover.   If there is a security threat and the government wants to ban CDCians from traveling or wants to question them, then it needs to be made public and the proper and lawful procedures should be put in place.      This young woman is first and foremost a Liberia citizens who has equal rights under our constitution.   I believe her travel should be restricted only if she is thought to have committed a criminal offence, but not just because she is a member of a political party.","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 14:12:23","Kimmie Weeks",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"WE DONÃ¢â‚¬ÂT WANT WAR AGAIN IN LIBERIA

After five years of beginning to experience what a taste of democracy, education, freedom, and   social equality feel like for this generation, the political leaders of old, today stand at the threshold of a new dawn determining again the future of millions of young Liberia, who for the past 21 years have being stripped of their dignity, cognitive and human rights, education, and liberty.  The impact of what happened yesterday is a revelatory expression that shows the failure of the old bureaucratic political leadership practices by previous generation: putting power, self-aggrandizement, and popularity ahead of people.   Let us not ignore this reality because it has the potential again to degenerate into another repercussion that disenfranchises and cripples the young generation from being potent and erudite to lead the future of Liberia.  Yesterday was a suitable moment for presidential candidates (UP &CDC) to have spoken a mandate of peace and calm under-girded by non-violence; rather they watch the eve of a peaceful historical moment turned into a violent scenario.  Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, once said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I must follow the people. Am I not their leader?Ã¢â‚¬Â (ChangingMinds.org). This to me is the true characteristic of leadersÃ¢â‚¬â€having the desire to lead but doing so by the auspices of the Liberia people and their interest. Whatever the condition was yesterday, change does not come about through violence, if it does, than our history of violence should have delivered to us a lasting change. Change I believe comes by employing a non-violence protest sustained by self-respect and self-controlÃ¢â‚¬â€it is what Dr. Martin Luther King called Ã¢â‚¬Å“creative protestÃ¢â‚¬Â (disengaged from physical violence).

Today marks another dayÃ¢â‚¬â€whatever the differences are, the young Liberia are not prepare for another act of violence, as evident by the respond of the young people who  turn out today to exercise their rights  to vote. This I believe is a message to political leaders in Liberia, who are still romanticized by the rhetoric of the antiquated political constructÃ¢â‚¬â€that resort to power greed and violence as a mean.  This message is clear and simple, captivating the attentions of the international communities, especially Liberia youth around the world: We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want war again in our country. While we are praying for the best outcome, we are also strategic that any fatal attempt to jeopardize the future of young people in Liberia, will resolve into a large scale of non-violence protect and advocacy in Liberia with a clear intention-- fuel by technological networking and the media attention around the world.  We have learned the most democratic and creative intervention for change in Africa, from Egypt and TunisiaÃ¢â‚¬â€and we are prepared to take this step (creative technological protest) for the betterment of change and democracy.  We call on all Liberia, concern advocates, and institutions around the world to get ready and be alert to network and provide resources to foster a cost of Change and Freedom for Liberia because --WE DONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T WANT WAR  AGAIN IN LIBERIA.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-08 16:11:36","Adam M Kyne",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

There is a sense that people are afraid to come out and vote and this could naturally have an impact on turnout.The  opposition is calling for protests today and asking their supporters to  wear black, and are calling today a funeral for democracy in Liberia.""  our correspondent said.Meanwhile human rights group Amnesty  International (AI) on Tuesday urged police and all Liberia political  candidates to act to stop the election related violence and prevent  further bloodshed andÃ‚Â recommended an independent and impartial  investigation into possible human rights abuses during the election  period.Carolyn Norris,Ã‚Â Amnesty InternationalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deputy director  for Africa, said in a press statement that politicians and police need  to demonstrate that their main concern is protecting lives"" after deadly  clashes erupted between police and opposition supporters on Monday.

By posting this video, I am not justifying the use of excessive force by some members of the LNP, but trying to put to rest the claims that the events that took place yesterday were under direct orders from anyone and that the protesters were attacked unprovoked.  If you notice, it looks like armed members of the LNP did not arrive at the scene until after the protesters began throwing stones and broke through the UNMIL and LNP barricade.

"One day I am a UP sympathizers, the next day I am a Cidian. Well, that's human nature and it is pointless to respond to all this. The fact remains, that as journalists and in the line of work we do, there are no permanent friends. We will work to the dictates of our conscience, plain simple.This site was created bearing in mind that differences will ensue but that in all this, we must show respect and muster the spirit to dialogue constructively. Remember, when we posted UP campaign rallies in three counties in straight succession, CDC guys said we were biased. When we covered Brumskine rally at the ATS, people said it was done to deliberately shame the Brumskine turnout. When we cover the CDC rally, some folks said we give them more space and coverage. Just when we were releasing our monitoring report, portions that dealt with Truth FM was rejected by people aligned with UP, whereas sections dealing with the shortfalls of Love and Kings FM were overlooked.  When we presented our initial account of the Nov. 7 CDC riot most UP sympathizers commended the update but when we brought photo details, we are having to face their court of law.Now the State has illegally close down three radio stations in Liberia, we are being dammed because we choose not to be silent. An interesting dilemma, you may conjecture. We will do our jobs. We will report objectively and we will do this bearing in mind that Liberia is the one place we have and no where else. What matters ultimately is the truth and the truth we will stand by. In few hours, we will release preliminary results on our site from the second round of coverage of the elections- a work that earned us bad branding from CDC supporters and the AfricanStandard Online Newspaper. At the time, we were VERY Objective in the eyes of UP supporters and biased in the eyes of CDC. Follow the results and enjoy the Run-off.

"The events that unfolded in Liberia yesterday are heart breaking and disconcerting. When Fwww.frontpageafrica.com alerted Liberia of Weah and Alan WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan to hijack the country, skeptics said it was another ploy to create fear amongst the citizenry. Between June 2010 and October 2011, we have seen caches of arms and ammunitions being discovered and ceased in Grand Gedeh County near the Ivori...an border, Nimba County as well as River Gee County and near the Liberia/Sierra Leonean border. If these trends did not send a message to the Liberia people, then we probably are all asleep. Quite recently,WinstonTubman had an interview with Reuters news and warned of chaos in Liberia and the sub-region if the run-of elections were not called off. Who the hell does he think he is?WinstonTubman failed miserably as Head of the United Nations Mission in Somalia and wants Liberia to be ungovernable as Somalia. The waves of violence by CDC are well calculated and as such, drastic actions should be taken againstWinstonTubman, Weah and their group of hooligans. Liberia should not sit supinely and allow CDC to incite violence and threaten the young democracy that we are trying to nurture and sustain. While I sympathize with those who lost loved ones during the fracas I do support the proactive stance of the Police in protecting lives and properties. Why were the United Nations vehicles vandalized? Why was George KailondoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business ransacked and looted? I saw this coming when those gross ignoramuses (CDCians), uncompromising bigots and butt heads viciously attacked Eugene NagbeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home and cars. We cannot allow this to continue. Could this have happened under Master Sergeant Samuel K. Doe or Charles Ghankay Taylor? Thanks immensely to all peace loving and well-meaning Liberia who turned out and exercised their vote without fear. Under no condition will we revert to the brutal and uncivilized past that our country had to endure. In union strong success is sure we cannot fail. Forward ever and backward never! God bless Liberia!

"The events that unfolded in Liberia yesterday are heart breaking and disconcerting. When www.frontpageafrica.com alerted Liberia of Weah and Alan WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan to hijack the country, skeptics said it was another ploy to create fear amongst the citizenry. Between June 2010 and October 2011, we have seen caches of arms and ammunitions being discovered and ceased in Grand Gedeh County near the Ivorian border, Nimba County as well as River Gee County and near the Liberia/Sierra Leonean border.  If these trends did not send a message to the Liberia people, then we probably are all asleep.  Quite recently,WinstonTubman had an interview with Reuters news and warned of chaos in Liberia and the sub-region if the run-of elections were not called off. Who the hell does he think he is?WinstonTubman failed miserably as Head of the United Nations Mission in Somalia and wants Liberia to be ungovernable as Somalia. The waves of violence by CDC are well calculated and as such, drastic actions should be taken againstWinstonTubman, Weah and their group of hooligans. Liberia should not sit supinely and allow CDC to incite violence and threaten the young democracy that we are trying to nurture and sustain. While I sympathize with those who lost loved ones during the fracas I do  support the proactive stance of the Police in protecting lives and properties. Why were the United Nations vehicles vandalized? Why was George KailondoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business ransacked and looted? I saw this coming when those gross ignoramuses (CDCians), uncompromising bigots and butt heads viciously attacked Eugene NagbeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home and cars. We cannot allow this to continue. Could this have happened under Master Sergeant Samuel K. Doe or Charles Ghankay Taylor? Thanks immensely to all peace loving and well-meaning Liberia who turned out and exercised their vote without fear. Under no condition will we revert to the brutal and uncivilized past that our country had to endure. In union strong success is sure we cannot fail. Forward ever  and backward never! God bless Liberia!","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-08 18:11:13","Macon B. Garway",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"You are right. When you have little to lose, you take more risks. I recently was read the President's job plan for the next six years and it included a reasonable number of new jobs promised over the next 6yrs.Reasonable if one compared the number of corporations coming into the country with their employee needs. Reasonable in that infrastructural plans for roads and bridges could use this kind of unskilled labor, etc. Because all industries were destroyed during the war and we had unskilled labor and no investors, plus foreign debt, it has taken these first 6 yrs just to get to point of attracting investors and rebuilding basic industries.Also our political instability continues to frighten off even Liberia entrepreneurs in the diaspora who may employ many of the youth. Development is slow but the jobs will trickle in at several thousands a year, as long as there's peace. With such a large youth population, it will be difficult for all the youth to find work immediately. So some will have to go to the community colleges planned in each county, get vocational training, etc. and be given some purpose that leads them into employment.Rebuilding a failed, broken state is not an easy task.I don't envy EJS but most of her initiatives over the last 6 yrs and for the next administration seem progressive enough.","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 18:20:19","Bindu Padmore Wotorson",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

I do condemn the incident yesterday and regret the death of this young guy someone must be head accountable of this..in my own mind, the leaders that make those innocent youths to get on the streets should be head accountable. If only they had good motives, they would not have violated by disobeying authority to commence this march. I guess if they have conscience, they should be regretting whie they decided that. Again instead of quieting situation see them speaking out so loud..""This elelction should be postpone"" "" the noble peace prize should be taken back"" All sorts of nonsense that cannot help the situation.

"Mr. Kpargoi, it is simple. Allegations of fraud were infinitesimal and not widespread. The Liberia elections like elections everywhere are always plagued with incidents of irregularities. Al Gore reportedly won the elections in the United States, but the Presidency was given to George W. Bush. The US Supreme Court ruled and determined that the level of irregularities did not warrant an overturn of the results. Americans did not destroy their country or engage in hostilities. The United Nations, European Union, African Union, Carter Center, ECOWAS and other bodies monitored the Liberia elections and deemed it to free, fair and transparent.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-08 19:09:51","Macon B.

"I feel bad when everyone in Liberia wants to condemne and make derogatory comments about journalism and journalists in the country. Our journalists are doing very well given the circumstances and environment in which they work. In Liberia, journalist who do not broadcast or report what the priviledged public want to hear or read, are branded most times as not being professional journalists. In journalism, everyone needs to be heard; everyone's story needs to be told. If journalist or media institution were on Monday only reporting what the government or it's sympathizers wanted to hear, how were we going to know that there were fatalities and injuries. I read many comments on postings trying to justify the closure of media institutions in the aftermath of the Monday incident, and otherwise questioning the professionalism of journalists and media institutions. But GOL did not have to use well armed police to enforce the closure of the Radio and TV stations, if it is true that there was a court order. Where were the court officers? Why do we use the guns to intimidate unarmed citizens? Most of you always say the journalist has not reported a balanced story when your side is not explained.  Granted.This government is gradually incresing it's abuse record despite the gains made so far. It is under obligation to be tolerant with the freedoms it is accepting. May be PresidentEllenJohnsonSirleaf did not know what happened. I can therefore imagine how embarrased she was when she heard about the proceedure used to shut down those stations. Because continuous closure of those institutions is not healthy for her gains. When she used to be on the run, it was the Liberia Press that took risks to aid her escapes from Presidents Doe and Taylor. Many times she invited Journalists to secret locations where she made statements daring to those administrations and told journalist to embargo until she left the country. It was the Liberia journalists who made her and popularized the ""Iron Lady"" name that the whole world knows. Let us remember that doing the wrong thing wronly or doing the wrong thing rightly, does not still make it right. So please stop blaming the journalists.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-08 19:42:32","Samuel Abu",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

When I joined the GOL back in 2006 a lot of my friends mocked at me for working from 9a-10p for a $2500ld pay check initially when they would just sit at home and get far more than I made as a skilled worker. The industries that are now hiring employs over 80% of young qualified workers. Unskilled workers are also hired short term for govt projects, there are young professional programs in country, there are internship programs, young people are recruited and trained for all major govt events, etc. And like Bindu said the impact we need to see are not immediate--they're long term. Young people should also make use of themselves by starting small businesses. I know a lot who have and this has kept them busy, focused and out of trouble.

I know you will quickly cry, but what about MFI operating in Liberia? Well, the data shows that over 90% of their capital is lent to women, typically head of households. Another tangible solution, create a state-owned bank or credit facility for Small & Medium sized Enterprises ( SME).

MONROVIA | Tue Nov 8, 2011 3:27pm EST
(Reuters) - Many Liberia failed to vote in a presidential run-off on Tuesday, poll observers said, some people staying away for fear of further violence and others following an opposition boycott appeal.

Voters trickled into polling stations in the capital Monrovia in much lower numbers than the first round vote last month, Reuters witnesses said. Feedback from elsewhere in the West African state also put turnout down by late-afternoon.

Incumbent EllenJohnsonSirleaf is tipped to win re-election after leading the first round vote, and because second placed challenger WinstonTubman has withdrawn from the contest citing electoral fraud.

But a low turnout risks harmingEllenJohnsonSirleaf's authority in a new term despite international praise for the new Nobel peace laureate and broad condemnation ofWinstonTubman's boycott call.

United Nations peacekeepers were deployed, but the streets of the capital were quiet after a day of clashes that officials say killed at least two.

""People are taking a long time to come because of the situation of yesterday. There is fear in the voters,"" said Mitchell Gbarteah, an election worker in Monrovia's West Point, a slum of tin and wood hovels.

MONROVIA | Tue Nov 8, 2011 3:27pm EST
(Reuters) - Many Liberia failed to vote in a presidential run-off on Tuesday, poll observers said, some people staying away for fear of further violence and others following an opposition boycott appeal.

Voters trickled into polling stations in the capital Monrovia in much lower numbers than the first round vote last month, Reuters witnesses said. Feedback from elsewhere in the West African state also put turnout down by late-afternoon.

Incumbent EllenJohnsonSirleaf is tipped to win re-election after leading the first round vote, and because second placed challenger WinstonTubman has withdrawn from the contest citing electoral fraud.

But a low turnout risks harmingEllenJohnsonSirleaf's authority in a new term despite international praise for the new Nobel peace laureate and broad condemnation ofWinstonTubman's boycott call.

United Nations peacekeepers were deployed, but the streets of the capital were quiet after a day of clashes that officials say killed at least two.

""People are taking a long time to come because of the situation of yesterday. There is fear in the voters,"" said Mitchell Gbarteah, an election worker in Monrovia's West Point, a slum of tin and wood hovels.

Officials from two observer groups said low numbers were also being reported by colleagues country-wide.

""We have spoken to our observers across the country and the indication that we are getting is that turnout is very low,"" said Dan Saryee, head of the Liberia Democratic Institute, which is tracking the vote.

""If it continues the way it is going now, I can safely say that turnout will be 25-35 percent,"" he said. In the Oct 11 first round vote, turnout was more than 71 percent.

MONROVIA | Tue Nov 8, 2011 3:27pm EST
(Reuters) - Many Liberia failed to vote in a presidential run-off on Tuesday, poll observers said, some people staying away for fear of further violence and others following an opposition boycott appeal.

Voters trickled into polling stations in the capital Monrovia in much lower numbers than the first round vote last month, Reuters witnesses said. Feedback from elsewhere in the West African state also put turnout down by late-afternoon.

Incumbent EllenJohnsonSirleaf is tipped to win re-election after leading the first round vote, and because second placed challenger WinstonTubman has withdrawn from the contest citing electoral fraud.

But a low turnout risks harmingEllenJohnsonSirleaf's authority in a new term despite international praise for the new Nobel peace laureate and broad condemnation ofWinstonTubman's boycott call.

United Nations peacekeepers were deployed, but the streets of the capital were quiet after a day of clashes that officials say killed at least two.

""People are taking a long time to come because of the situation of yesterday. There is fear in the voters,"" said Mitchell Gbarteah, an election worker in Monrovia's West Point, a slum of tin and wood hovels.

Officials from two observer groups said low numbers were also being reported by colleagues country-wide.

""We have spoken to our observers across the country and the indication that we are getting is that turnout is very low,"" said Dan Saryee, head of the Liberia Democratic Institute, which is tracking the vote.

""If it continues the way it is going now, I can safely say that turnout will be 25-35 percent,"" he said. In the Oct 11 first round vote, turnout was more than 71 percent.

The poll is the first locally-organised presidential election since a civil war ended in 2003. It is expected to pave the way for new investment, but fears are rising it could instead usher in open-ended political turmoil.

On one street corner in the crumbling coastal capital, a group of two dozen young men stood discussing politics.

""I will never vote, the government has stacked things massively against us ... They came in there shooting, not just teargas, at harmless people"" said Anthony Korvayan, 28.

On Monday, police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds ofWinstonTubman's supporters and officers also fired live rounds when they stormedWinstonTubman's CDC party headquarters. [ID:nL6E7M726J]

But, standing next to Korvayan, Benedict Hena held up an ink-stained finger, and said he had voted: ""It is our right.""

U.S. President Barack Obama called on Liberia security forces to show restraint and allow peaceful protest, and he warned against any voting violations. [ID:nN1E7A622S]

""The international community will hold accountable those who choose to obstruct the democratic process,"" he said.

Two radio stations seen to supportWinstonTubman and running mate and former football star George Weah, were shut down overnight.

After voting in Fefee, her home town just outside Monrovia,EllenJohnsonSirleaf sought to dampen tensions, saying she regretted the loss of life and promised an investigation.

""Liberia is going to move forward. We will find a way to heal the wounds. We will also find a way to reconcile people,"" she said, vowing to make youth a priority of her mandate.

However,WinstonTubman, a former U.N. ambassador, accused the president of using ""violence against peaceful people."" On Tuesday he remained vague on his next move. ""We will boycott today and wait and see how that pans out.""

Liberia is one of the world's poorest countries and some 14 years of war killed nearly 250,000 and left its infrastructure in ruins.

""DON'T WANT TROUBLE""

Johnson-Sirleaf -- whose standing at home, where many complain improvements have come too slowly, is not always on a par with international praise for the recently-named Nobel Peace Prize winner -- won nearly 44 percent of the first round vote.

She has since secured the backing of the third-placed finisher, former warlord Prince Johnson.

Tubman, who won about 33 percent in the first round , has alleged three ballot boxes were tampered with and said he would only participate in a run-off if it were delayed by two to four weeks and if counting procedures were amended.

The October 11 first round was broadly accepted by international observers and regional bodies have criticizedWinstonTubman's boycott decision.

Yet many of his supporters are unemployed former fighters and, while it is too early to be sure of turnout, analysts warned a successful boycott would complicate the incumbent's next mandate, perhaps forcing her into dialogue withWinstonTubman.

""Instead of consolidation and construction, it will be a second mandate of justification and possibly power-sharing,"" said Lydie Boka, head of risk consultancy StrategiCo.

Liberia's iron ore and oil have already attracted major firms including ArcelorMittal, BHP Billiton and Anadarko Petroleum and a smooth poll could entice more.

Many in Liberia are just hoping for peace.

""We don't want any trouble. But monkey and baboon not getting along,"" said a Monrovia resident who called himself Tarr, using the nicknames Liberia have given the candidates.

MONROVIA | Tue Nov 8, 2011 3:27pm EST
(Reuters) - Many Liberia failed to vote in a presidential run-off on Tuesday, poll observers said, some people staying away for fear of further violence and others following an opposition boycott appeal.

Voters trickled into polling stations in the capital Monrovia in much lower numbers than the first round vote last month, Reuters witnesses said. Feedback from elsewhere in the West African state also put turnout down by late-afternoon.

Incumbent EllenJohnsonSirleaf is tipped to win re-election after leading the first round vote, and because second placed challenger WinstonTubman has withdrawn from the contest citing electoral fraud.

But a low turnout risks harmingEllenJohnsonSirleaf's authority in a new term despite international praise for the new Nobel peace laureate and broad condemnation ofWinstonTubman's boycott call.

United Nations peacekeepers were deployed, but the streets of the capital were quiet after a day of clashes that officials say killed at least two.

""People are taking a long time to come because of the situation of yesterday. There is fear in the voters,"" said Mitchell Gbarteah, an election worker in Monrovia's West Point, a slum of tin and wood hovels.

Officials from two observer groups said low numbers were also being reported by colleagues country-wide.

""We have spoken to our observers across the country and the indication that we are getting is that turnout is very low,"" said Dan Saryee, head of the Liberia Democratic Institute, which is tracking the vote.

""If it continues the way it is going now, I can safely say that turnout will be 25-35 percent,"" he said. In the Oct 11 first round vote, turnout was more than 71 percent.

The poll is the first locally-organised presidential election since a civil war ended in 2003. It is expected to pave the way for new investment, but fears are rising it could instead usher in open-ended political turmoil.

On one street corner in the crumbling coastal capital, a group of two dozen young men stood discussing politics.

""I will never vote, the government has stacked things massively against us ... They came in there shooting, not just teargas, at harmless people"" said Anthony Korvayan, 28.

On Monday, police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds ofWinstonTubman's supporters and officers also fired live rounds when they stormedWinstonTubman's CDC party headquarters. [ID:nL6E7M726J]

But, standing next to Korvayan, Benedict Hena held up an ink-stained finger, and said he had voted: ""It is our right.""

U.S. President Barack Obama called on Liberia security forces to show restraint and allow peaceful protest, and he warned against any voting violations. [ID:nN1E7A622S]

""The international community will hold accountable those who choose to obstruct the democratic process,"" he said.

Two radio stations seen to supportWinstonTubman and running mate and former football star George Weah, were shut down overnight.

After voting in Fefee, her home town just outside Monrovia,EllenJohnsonSirleaf sought to dampen tensions, saying she regretted the loss of life and promised an investigation.

""Liberia is going to move forward. We will find a way to heal the wounds. We will also find a way to reconcile people,"" she said, vowing to make youth a priority of her mandate.

However,WinstonTubman, a former U.N. ambassador, accused the president of using ""violence against peaceful people."" On Tuesday he remained vague on his next move. ""We will boycott today and wait and see how that pans out.""

Liberia is one of the world's poorest countries and some 14 years of war killed nearly 250,000 and left its infrastructure in ruins.

""DON'T WANT TROUBLE""

Johnson-Sirleaf -- whose standing at home, where many complain improvements have come too slowly, is not always on a par with international praise for the recently-named Nobel Peace Prize winner -- won nearly 44 percent of the first round vote.

She has since secured the backing of the third-placed finisher, former warlord Prince Johnson.

Tubman, who won about 33 percent in the first round , has alleged three ballot boxes were tampered with and said he would only participate in a run-off if it were delayed by two to four weeks and if counting procedures were amended.

The October 11 first round was broadly accepted by international observers and regional bodies have criticizedWinstonTubman's boycott decision.

Yet many of his supporters are unemployed former fighters and, while it is too early to be sure of turnout, analysts warned a successful boycott would complicate the incumbent's next mandate, perhaps forcing her into dialogue withWinstonTubman.

""Instead of consolidation and construction, it will be a second mandate of justification and possibly power-sharing,"" said Lydie Boka, head of risk consultancy StrategiCo.

Liberia's iron ore and oil have already attracted major firms including ArcelorMittal, BHP Billiton and Anadarko Petroleum and a smooth poll could entice more.

Many in Liberia are just hoping for peace.

""We don't want any trouble. But monkey and baboon not getting along,"" said a Monrovia resident who called himself Tarr, using the nicknames Liberia have given the candidates.

"Sekou Sheriff, you are quoting directly from the SAP's [Structural Adjustment Program] play book and haven't provided any tangible solution to job creation. Job creation comes with job readiness and preparedness, so, while you tackle the creation of jobs and more jobs, you should also tackle the issue of preparing folks to take on those jobs once they are available. The challenge has NOT only been the difficulty in creating permanent employment, it has also been encouraging young people to take advantage of the many learning opportunities. 

Take for instance, the RR component of the DDRR provided an outlet for ex-coms to acquire technical life skills and even though they receive stipends on a monthly basis, many of them sold their slots to folks who already had skills and wanted to improve on them and weren't ex-coms. So, even with the incentives to motivate folks, they weren't willing to take advantage of the golden opportunity. It saddens me, and going forward, this is the challenge for NOT just this gov't but for us all as Liberia. 

One way we can help to serve as a cushion for national gov't also is to get involve in small business ventures. Imagine if 500 Liberia from the Diaspora went home and created several small business that would employ 10 Liberia each, through the multiplier effect, you will have 5,000 new jobs created and if the dependency ratio is 10:1 [10 unemployed to 1 employed], conservatively, we will have empowered 50,000 Liberia alone. 

So, we expect gov't to do more, let's also develop ways in which we can complement the effort of gov't...Thanks!","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 21:23:04","Stephen Johnson",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

I posed a simple hypothetical question, which is valid question because CDC is on the ballot and could win if they garner enough votes.  My dear brother, your response was waaaay off the charts.  Even if i was a member of the rulling party or in the government (which i'm not) should not warrent you to post comments with so much venom and bitterness.   As young people, we have to reach the point where we can discuss and question everything without feeling there is a need to become hostile or defensive.  Violence and hostility solves nothing.  Its not about who has the loudest voice.   Its about how we can share ideas and thoughts even if we differ.

"A BBC reporter says Ellen re-election will be tainted by a low turnout.
The BBC's Jonathan Paye-Layleh in central Monrovia was at a polling station when voting began. He says just eight people were waiting to cast their ballots, compared to hundreds last month. Thereporter says he received similar reports from other parts of Liberia, including the second city, Buchanan. All polling stations closed on time at 18:00 GMT and some closed before then when it became clear that no more voters would show up, he says. It seems many people felt it was pointless to vote because MrsEllenJohnsonSirleaf was assured of victory, our reporter says. ...Source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15633697","Liberia Elections","2011-11-08 21:41:00","J Isaac Garley",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"The elections are officially over. It's now time to say hello, meet each other half way and say, if I insulted or offended you, it wasn't intentional, I'M SORRY MA, I'M SORRY PA, I'M SORRY SON/DAUGHTER, I LOVE YOU. One major thing we so often forget in the midst of these heated debates is the fact that one thing brought us all here, THE LOVE OF LIBERTY. In the midst of our tragedies, that love kept us here, when the world thought we couldn't get it back together, that love proved them wrong, and I believe together, that love can take us to our best days that is yet to come. A lot of things happened in these few months, but we've been through worse my people. The recent incident in Liberia is a signal that the very young peace we've enjoyed uninterrupted for just six years is so fragile that it demands to be held tightly and priceless. We will all partially be held accountable if we allow it to be broken. There are countless reasons why we can't avoid this peace broken; Lets reflect on the many lives we lost two decades ago, the many destructions we're now rebuilding, the many who are still struggling to get it back together, and the many memories of a sweet land call Liberia. This generation, the younger generation have a huge task ahead, and such task will ONLY be achieve with a new attitude. That attitude has to be lead by LOVE, PEACE, UNITY, RESPECT, DIGNITY, BEING OUR BROTHER'S KEEPER ONCE MORE, AND PROSPERITY. My hope is that whoever wins this election cease the moment to bring Liberia back together instead of poppin bottles and making a big political speeches. We are not identified around the world as CDCIANS, UPIANS, OR INDEPENDENTS', we are identify as Liberia. And with that great connection, I urge us all to rise above all other and move forward like brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, uncle and aunts, but most importantly as one people, who came here by one love, THE LOVE OF LIBERTY. Peace.","Liberia Elections","2011-11-09 00:10:18","Robert David G",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"Around 10 p.m., November 8, 2011, the radio station of the Eternal Love Winning Africa (ELWA) went up in flames. Although no cause has been officially established, initial reports say that an electrical fault is not likely. Being a religious broadcaster with no political affiliation, it may be only coincidental that the fire followed the intense activities of the days leading to the November 8 presidential run-off election in Liberia. Late Tuesday night, ELWA staff along with the Liberia Fire Service fought hard to contain the fire. About two-thirds of the station's collection of CDs and tapes and a sound mixer could be rescued from shelves after the entire station was doused with water by firefighters.

"This is such a terrible ""Shame!"" The international community is observing this carefully. It broke my heart to see the condition of the country during my visit. What is wrong with these people? Are they more concerned with power and control, than working towards a brighter future for the people of the country? Investments from foreign countries are being held up due to this foolishness. No one wants to invest because the country is ""Very"" unstable. The people need to start collectively crying out to God so that the grip satan has over the country can be broken.

When did you become an advocate for journalists' rights? I am asking theses questions because I vividly remembered you being very active in party politics at the time the Taylor administration saw the independent media as an osticle to its progress and chose the crack down as a means of silencing the press.

"People, read this. From the Telegraph ""Malcolm Joseph, Executive Director of the Centre for Media Studies and Peace Building, told The Daily Telegraph the government shut three pro-CDC radio stations and two television stations owned by MrWinstonTubman's running mate, former AC Milan footballer George Weah.

The UN and US criticized MrWinstonTubman's boycott and urged Liberia to vote.

Though the former diplomat's actions will not prevent MsEllenJohnsonSirleaf winning, it risks giving her a hollow victory since she ran unopposed.

Alex Vines, who heads the Africa Programme at Chatham House, told The Daily Telegraph MrWinstonTubman may have orchestrated the discord.

""There's a lot of posturing that goes on in second rounds. And after the opposition called a boycott it's no surprise there was violence.

""As it was looking more likelyEllenJohnsonSirleaf would win, this (violence) was about the CDC creating leverage with which they could negotiate some power. It's the politics of patronage,"" he said.""","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-09 02:54:07","Lawson Zackey",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"Okay this is what I believed in 'IF WE ALL AGREE THERE WILL BE NO WRONG'.Thanks to the Oppositions, observers and independents for disagreeing with some of us throughout the electoral process.It was worth learning than just watching everyone agreeing to whatever comes out of my mouth or head.The election is now over it is time to embrace peace cuz When we find peace within ourself, we will become... the kind of person who can live at peace with others.Am calling on everyone especially Lewis Smith, Siezie Siafa,Acarous Gray,Victor Nyankan, Bobby Peabody, Bestman Lammena, Vivia Clark, Vicky Coleman and many others to embrace peace and put away our differences.We have all experienced a great communication skills.Moreover, it was a great moment interacting despite our differences and political ideology. Now is the time to move our country and citizens forward.Let's talk to our brothers, sisters,relatives and friends back home to say NO to VIOLENCE and Say YES to PEACE.Our future is so bright that we can't afford to misuse it through violence for greedy politicians. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Peace is not something you wish for; It's something you make, Something you do, Something you are, And something you give away.Ã¢â‚¬Â Robert Fulghum. If I ever offended anyone in the tough political season, I say never mind ya, but I was glad that we had differences and did not shed blood, that's what makes conflict to be good.

Those that died were involved in a illegal demonstration which turned violent!I am sad we lost their precious lives yet realistically people do get victimized in riots....To clarify your doubt which led you to assumed n guessed that they or the protesters had no weapon;they were reported to have thrown stones at the security and blocked major boulevards and set up barriers...Enough of those lawlessness brother;if such actions were not curbed your phone would have been ringing as your relatives from Liberia won't have had the peace we have now!My regret is that we lost souls and I do hope some questions will be answered by the authorities as per the fring of live bullets!Yet my advice to Liberia is simply that we all note that Liberia is a sovereign nation with a sitting president charged with the responsibility of protecting us all..","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-09 08:04:26","Earnest Garbleejay Smith",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

There were the wounded
There lie the dead

The police were ready
Their forces stood armed
Tear gasses were fired
And pebbles were thrown

With fear in our eyes
We tried to go home
Broad Street was deserted, 
War tankers patrolled

But somewhere in town
A mother cried softly
Her child had been murdered
Her little boy killed

The questions weighed heavy
Reminders were stark
Is this the same country?

"NEC requested that the CDC provide evidence to substantiate their claim of electoral fraud and they were provided dates for hearing. At three hearings they pleaded for more time and were granted permission to gather more evidence to support their claim of electoral fraud. At the time of the last hearing, the CDC had not presented any genuine substantiation of electoral fraud from the October 11 elections. They only provided pictures that even if you observed keenly will notice that they were nil but shams. They decided to play hide and seek with NEC until the FromayanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incidence at NEC office on 9th street. They demanded his resignation which happened days after the incidence. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why no one has commented on this fabrication made by the CDC. Even international bodies and other electoral institutions around the world present for the elections claimed it was free, fair and transparent. These institutions even challenged the CDC to provide their evidence which never materialized. So what do you want people to say? What do you want NEC, the Government of Liberia and International organization like the UN, AU, ECOWAS or other electoral bodies to say?","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-09 09:10:02","Varney Gean",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Its unfortunate that a life was lost, but we must realise that indiscipline has no room in Liberia today. Their ignorance allowed them to be used by the party leaders who had this agenda since October 11. These children are not serious, they just believe in begging for handouts. You help them out with funds to start something meaningful and they burn it all up by getting high on the proceeds. Even if they're unemployed, it doesn't mean that they should allow themselves to be used by the CDC to incite chaos. The Police were begging them to get off the street, but they just stood there making comments like ""we'll die for CDC, we'll burn the oldma house, the country pregnant, etc"". Its just sad!!! The organizers should be held responsible along with whoever fired the live round. The Allan White recommendations are being implemented but its good that the doc was leaked months ago.

I see checago Sawo comment as being asymmetrically and bifurcated, completely unbalanced and not objective. I could say that my brothre Michael Kennedy call me and told me CDC is planning WAR, is my brother story authentic? NO is the answer, anybody can amplify stuff to fit the desires. Saye-Maye Cole admonished this brother and other folks jump in and became to accenuate the issue as if Saye is attacking checago infant foundation as compare to a reputable institution Checago attacked by following a mouth-to mouth allegation on the Liberia NATIONAL POLICE. I must make it clear that i am not interested in discussing Checago private foundation, but if you want to be an independent be independent and dont pretend and later play the victim card. People personal attacks should be a hallmark to a good leader, people always attack me personally- well, it is what is it....But dont appear on facebook after been away for awhile with bogus story that has the potential to derailed the PEACE in Liberia.

"I personally regret the incident that took place at the CDC headquarters on Monday, this is a sad situation but we need to await the police/UNMIL investigations before making judgement. However, now that the RUN-OFF Election is over, we need to begin reconciling as Liberia. We need to consolidate all efforts to heal the wounds resulting from the elections. Let continue to talk to our brothers and sisters from the CDC and the UP to refrain from using inciteful words or comments. We are all Liberia, even before we were CDC, UP, LP, NUDP, etc we were Liberia. Let us use this medium to preach peace and reconciliation to reduce the tension resulting from the elections. Please, please let the media show some sense of natioanlity and matuarity in their work, when you sometimes turn on your radio you hear journalists saying things like they have taken sides. Some sound like the voice of the oppositions while others speak on bealf of the ruling party. This will not help us as a people.

"I don't understand why some people are refusing to face the fact. After all these tensions, claims and counter claims we shall all come together as one nation and one people.We have seen demonstrations in Europe, Asia and America over the years; especiallly the recent riot in London, no police officer fire gun at any demonstrator. Why in Africa security officers quick to fire at their fellow citizens. This is totally wrong and undemocratic. Where is the freedom of speech and civil liberty? I saw during the campaign, CDC standard bearers, CllrWinstonTubman and Amb Weah said freedom of speech and civil liberty were not priorities since indeed the constitution provides and guarantees them. This statement has taken the air way and print media during the entire campaign period. Other partisans and supporters ridiculed, reprimanded and made all sorts of inflamatory statements. Now the UP led Government has begun killing other partisans for protesting and unlawfully ordered the closure of other Radio and TV Stations. There were numbers of TV and radio stations that reported misleading stories and made lots of inflamatory stories whcih has the propensity of  plunging our country into total anarchy. In addition, other TV and Radio stations have lost their ethical value and credibility for airing governmnent supported campaign messages and not hearing much of other political parties. Where is the freedom of speech and civil liberty here? When in fact the government  denied and refused  to tell the international community how many lives lost (death) during Monday's incident at the CDC Headquarters. During their press statement, they only mentioned one person got killed during the exchange of fire, when in fact more than three persons got killed including several others injured. I am profoundly confused and disgusted here. ""Exchange of fire "" who is exchanging fire and with whom? This is totally misleading, inhumane,unacceptable and heartless. The truth shall come out one day and God shall judge us all by our deals. Guys, our police should learn to respect their citizens and their human rights; also respect the constitution which binds us together. Our police officers are always perpetrating violence against other citizens. See what they did the last time when they brutalized students in Monrovia and killed  Cavalla Rubber Plantation workers in Maryland. This is unacceptable and we must denoucnce using violence to resolve our differences . This is not a joke, we must stand up strongly and say no to violence. Those persons that got killed in the demonstration on Monday could be your brothers, sisters and relatives.

"@ All, we will not tolerate use of the media to practice hate speech. As Togar and all know, Kings FM have serious issues with LMC both for our decision not to include them in the Elections Support Program and two because we said they have been reporting irresponsibly. So, on the record, we have had issues with Kings FM, so we will not tolerate abuse of the airwaves. All the same, there are also stations included in the state petition, which we have found to be legally defective for reasons I will state later, that have been reasonably moderate. So, if Power must be closed, then I should assume Truth FM should follow suit because they have been used as the UP bastion to trade inflammatory rhetorics. So for the sake of parity and fairness, you can not close one station and leave the other to run verbal riots. Besides, the state made ""calculated"" legal blunders in their pursuit for the closure.   1. Procedural Problems. The state sought a petition to have the stations at the Criminal Court. Going to the criminal court should imply that the accused have committed a crime.

"Weather peaceful or not, assembling under the auspices of a political party during electioneering period after campaign was declared officially closed by NEC was not only inappropriate but ill-legal. Besides, to embark upon a peaceful march or demonstration, our laws say those concerned should obtain a permit from the ministry of Justice so that they will be assigned law enforcement officers to closely monitor their activities. The CDC did not get the approbation of the Justice ministry to march, weather peacefully or not on Monday, November 7, 2011. Having said that, the police in my opinion had no right to fire live bullets at unarmed protesters no matter their background and political affiliation. Tear gas, electric baton and other measures other than firing live bullets would have been the best options. The government says there was exchange of gun fire during their press conference on Monday evening, but they could not however state weather there was any arrest made of those bearing arms from CDC's end. Until date, there also is no information regarding any of those security officers, Nigerian or Liberia sustaining injury as a result of the allege firing from CDC compound. Attempt by the UNMIL officers to disarm some Liberia police officers for their shooting actions during the standoff as proven by one of the photos from the scene shows how their own security counterparts frown at the firing actions. This is highly regrettable and that all well meaning Liberia should detest the killing and urge state securities to exercise high degree of restraint when confronted with situations of these nature.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-09 13:16:07","Anderson Miamen",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

You can not seek an injunction or TRO using criminal procedural. Once you alleged a crime, the violator is under the jurisdiction of the state pending an outcome of his case. Therefore, it would make no sense to seek a restraining order. What would have made a legal sense, was to have issued a writ of arrest and not an injuction to force closure.

"Liberia Media Center: Our View On The Closure Of The Three Radio Stations
e will not tolerate use of the media to practice hate speech. As some of you might know Kings FM is on record of having serious issues with LMC both for on our  decision not to include them in the Elections Support Program and two because we said they have been reporting irresponsibly. Both complaints are before the Press Union of Liberia. So, on the record, we have had issues with Kings FM, so we will not tolerate abuse of the airwaves.

Now to the matter at hand. While we acknowledge that Kings and Love have been making with troublesome broadcast, we also believe Power has been quite moderate and was wrongly included in the state's legally defective petition.  So, if Power must be closed, then I should assume Truth FM should follow suit because they have been used as the UP bastion to trade inflammatory rhetorics. So for the sake of parity and fairness, you can not close one station and leave the other to run verbal riots. Besides, the state made ""calculated"" legal blunders in their pursuit for the closure.

 1. Procedural Problems. The state sought a petition to have the stations at the Criminal Court. Going to the criminal court should imply that the accused have committed a crime. In response to this alledged commission of a crime, should have been a writ of arrest or a writ of summouns not a letter under signature of a clerk of court calling for the instatement of a temporary restraining order. So, they erred first by going to the Criminal Court, and eventually praying the court for a civil rememdy (injunction/TRO). 

2. Further to this, the petition assuming it was proper, never had a stated cause of action. Lawyers will cearly understand this point but for ordinary people, to ask the court whether in a civil or criminal proceedings to restrain anyone, a stated cause of action should be made. This was not the case.

3.  More to that, there was no statement of the law or rule of law that was alledgedly violated. The only law cited was those that give authority to the agencies to act as agents of the state. Still on the subject, it is our expressed opinion that the matter was not handle with care. That the state failed to study the legal ramifications.

"OUR ONE AND ONLY NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNING PRESIDENT has shown us another example of her truly PEACEFUL behaviour. Sending ERU riot police to kill our people as some form of WARNING ""To not try that peaceful protest thing"" here. SHE opens her mouth about freedom of speech, but not when its a threat to her hungry quest for power? WHATS the point of having freedom of speech when you send armed men to close down the only radio stations that people can voice their opinion? Is this freedom of speech? What is the point of have an electoral process when you will use stolen funds to BUY yourself victory, leaving majority of the population feeling cheated, deprived, and unable to have their voice heard to secure a future for themselves? WHY TELL PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE LIVING IN A DEMOCRACY WHEN they will be shot and disturbed  when they try to protest about their grievances, Which kind of democracy is this when the president turns from Nobel winner to a hardcore dictator willing to do anything to stay in power. She goes as far as having her LNP head TORTURE OUR CITIZEN BECAUSE SHE ACCUSED NEC OFFICIALS OF FRAUD.

WHAT KIND OF DEMOCRATIC LEADER BASICALLY EXPELS THE HEADS of two heads of commissions put in place the benefit THE Liberia PEOPLE. THE TRC REPORT AND GAC AUDIT which are the two organs put in place for the betterment of Liberia and Liberia. THEIR FINDINGS ARE THROWN IN TH GUTTER, THEY ARE FIRED, HUMILIATED, AND PRACTICALLY FORCED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.... IS THIS DEMOCRACY? Democracy that leaves everyone opposing your views feeling insecure and unsafe.

How about the foreign businessmen that have had continuing conflict with this government  for supporting OTHER political parties. For example, George Haddad basically had his business taken away from Ellen when she came into power because he refused to support her during her campaign period, saying he believes that she is wicked as HE HAS GROWN UP IN LIBERIA. HOW ABOUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THREATENING TO CLOSE DOWN LONESTAR CELL. A company that has hired thousands of Liberia and a COMPANY THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT GAVE AN AWARD TO FOR  BEING THE MOST LAW ABIDING AND TAX PAYING BUSINESS IN LIBERIA??? ALL of a sudden you in criminalize them and throw threats to shut them down because BENONI UREY is supporting opposition?

"What is more important now is for the Government to reopen the media institutions.  We may not like what they are airing, but we have a choice not to listen to them. We have the alternative to listen to those stations that air what we like to hear.  It is difficult to justify the closure of media institutions for airing Ã¢â‚¬Å“hate messagesÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Most media institutions have taken sides during these elections. What happens to those institutions that promote Ã¢â‚¬Å“hate messagesÃ¢â‚¬Â against the opposition? Are we closing them down also? I doubt if we would.  Ellen has done some good work and I still think she is still the best person to lead Liberia at the moment.  This does not mean that others will not unnecessarily criticize her.  She must resist the temptation not to yield to the provocation of walking in the footsteps of Doe and Taylor. Doe closed down the Daily Observer, Foot Prints and ELCM. Taylor shut down Radio Veritas and Star Radio. They both have legal justifications in maintaining the Ã¢â‚¬Å“public peaceÃ¢â‚¬Â.   When both of them did that, their ministers hailed them for   maintaining the public peace. Today the same ministers condemned Doe and Taylor as dictators. There will always be legal reasons for Government to take action even when it is not  the right thing to do.  Those who ill-advised Ellen to shut down the media institutions did not do her well. Tomorrow, they would say something else. Ellen, resist the temptation, and reopen the media institutions. You have a legacy to be remembered for. Do not allow this to dim it.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-09 14:56:48","Alvin Winford",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"Fellow compatriots, i have and continue to hear lots of comments about the incident which took place Monday at the CDC headquarters in Congo town. In as much as it is a sad thing to see another human being lose his life, it is also a bad precedent for a group of citizens disregard and challenge the authority of a country. The CDC has recently vowed to undermine the government of the UP. The SG of the CDC, Moses Acarios Gray promised that they (CDC) will begin their undermining process with a non cooperation to some government functionaries. Some of these functionaries include the police. He indicated that CDC will not abide by the authority of the police, they will not pay taxes, and so on and so forth.
So my people, in the face of all these, the same CDC being aware that normally a day before an election in this country is reserve for reflection, went ahead and asked their partisans to converged at their party headquarters for what they (CDC leaders) called a peaceful gathering. The gathering in itself was illegal and had a defined motive. So, what do you all expect in this situation, especially when the CDC have vowed not to adhere to any police regulations in its determination to 'undermine theEllenJohnsonSirleaf led Unity party Government?

"My people, there is power in the social media. We have seen it being used to organize uprising in countries like Egypt and Syria. There is no reason to induce violence and hate through this medium (Facebook). The election is over. Let us put aside partisanship and focus on sending messages that will promote lasting peace in our country. 

The series of incidences that occurred over the last couple of days are very unfortunate, but it is time to move forward. We regret that lives had to be lost; leaving families in grief. However, finger pointing isn't going to help us. 

If we call ourselves intellectuals and patriots, we should be seeking avenues that will lead to adequate invention and resolution of what has transpired instead of sending messages that will induce violence. I'm sending my message as a concerned Liberia who wants the best for our beloved country, so I hope you will follow suit by putting aside partisanship and sending messages of peace, harmony, and reconciliation.

MY INDEPENDENT VIEW ON THE CLOSURE OF RADIO STATIONS IN LIBERIA.....

I like the discourse; but please allow me to take it from the government small and to the individual Journalists who are perceived to be preaching these hate messages or inflammatory. From a citizen/conflict sensitive journalist perspective; I would also shift most of the blames on our colleagues, those who have in all fairness refused to be professional and ethical...look at their face book pages and comments; listen to how they conduct talk-shows; they are not encouraging neither are they promoting peace at all...  Some Journalists transgressed ethically; either because they don't subscribed to the norms of the Press Union of Liberia or sometimes try to test the laws... Journalists are not above the laws this is why the World over we are guided by ethical principles and values.... in Liberia, we have the PUL Code of Ethics that speaks clearly on some of these issues and how Journalists should refrain from being perceived by the public as Ã¢â‚¬Å“trouble makersÃ¢â‚¬Â... But with that in mind, I only blame the Government for not giving PUL the power to license these media houses; because if that power was with the Union; by this time we would have had a robust but more professional media organizations in Liberia.

I think the press needs freedom.... The press must be free because a  free press in my mind has tremendous power, if power is defined as the
 capacity to influence others. The news media in a democracy like ours generally have the right to report information without prior
 government approval. Many countries provide legal protections
 to journalists so they can exercise that right. There are still some bad provisions and statutes in our Laws against press freedom and free speech... although the Government is trying with the FOI Law but we need more protection.
 

A little bit of ethical principles my friends; there is one sacred rule of Journalism said late reporter and prize-winning novelist John Hersey, who covered the
 aftermath of the atomic bomb attack on
 Hiroshima. 

He said Ã¢â‚¬Å“the writer must not invent.Ã¢â‚¬Â Ethical journalists do
 not put words in peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mouths or pretend to
 have been somewhere they have not. And they
 do not pass off the work of others as their own.

Some of us may know the the ethical dilemmas Journalists face every
day, either under pressure from owners, competitors,
 advertisers, and the public. We need a
 process to resolve these dilemmas, so that the
 journalism we produce is ethical. 

We need
 a way of thinking about ethical issues that

will help us make good decisions, as we move on.

The credibility of the press is linked to its
 commitment to truth, to the pursuit of
 accuracy, fairness, and objectivity and to
 the clear distinction between news and
 advertising. 

The attainment of these goals
 and the respect for ethical and professional
 values may not be imposed. These are the
 exclusive responsibility of journalists and the
 media. In a free society, it is public opinion
 that rewards or punishes.

Some of us Ã¢â‚¬Å“Liberia Journalists have refused to live with these principles all in the name of serving individuals, government officials for the little things they provide and we forsake the public good.

"Dirty Politics!!! 

I Ponder, is this how our country, democracy and peace will be threaten after every 6years??
Why our politicians are never afraid to divide the people of the country and drag our peace into the gutters when its elections time?  When will politicians get to understand that elections are not meant to divide the country??
When will Liberia begin to respect the Law of this country?  I asked all these questions because we Liberia fail to realize that dirty politics is the root cause to this problem today.
When one party comes out and say another party consist of hooligans, illiterate thugs who have a plan or a Document to drag or plunge this country into chaos
The other party on the other hand refuses to remain Civil and accept political defeat but rather involve into making statements that threaten the peace and security of the country and the people they seek to govern and remain disobedient to the rule of law and a sitting Government.
All of these put the state security forces on a very high alert or against a certain group of people.  The state security acted in the manner in which it did because of the Dirty Politics that ensue the political process in our country. Citizens who are neither UP nor CDC partisan lost their properties and some were even hospitalize all because of this Dirty Politics. 
If we Liberia want to be truly reconciled, we must do away with Dirty politics in this country.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-09 17:24:00","Swen Josiah",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
"There are two types of electorial  violence, it is in a study of these that solutions are found. The first is were a state has deep- rooted pwer asymmetries. In such cases, there will be no structural change with out reveloutionary transformation. I would suggest that there be focus on fundamental institutional reform across all specturms  of the national election commission of Liberia. The second is were election violence occurs when the election commission mismange  election information like one that took place in recent time in Liberia or rigging, theft, and irregularity and manipulation. In these cases electorial reform whichcorrect these flaws canlead to sound electoral  system that prevent the recurrence of future electorial violence.

"LMC/CEMESP Condemn Govt. Systematic Media Clampdown
Monrovia, Liberia
November 9, 2011
The Liberia Media Center and the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building categorically condemn the Liberia Government for the illegal closure of four broadcast entities in Liberia. 
In a petition filed before the judge of Criminal Court A on November 7, 2011, the state sought the permanent cancellation of the broadcast licenses of the four institutions claiming that the respondents illegally used their respective media outlets to broadcast hate messages against the Government and deliberately disseminated misinformation and messages of violence, instigating the people to rise up and take to the streets, amongst others.
In its petition, the State prayed that the court grant a request for temporary closure of the institutions pending a hearing, and subsequent to the hearing, ordered a permanent closure of Power FM and TV Station, Love FM and TV, Kings FM and Clar TV and Shatta FM.
Having reviewed the merits of the petition, LMC and CEMESP unequivocally condemn governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action to shut down the media outlets as this action clearly infringes on the petitionerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to due process.
While the LMC and CEMESP frown on the spreading of inflammatory rhetorics on the radio and in the newspaper, we are equally alarmed by the arbitrariness of governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions and the Criminal CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal granting of a legally defective petition. In its petition the Government of Liberia failed to state the law that was violated in count three of its petition.
Further, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition was defective as it failed to disclose a concise Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause of action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  According to Civil Procedure Law Section 16.5Ã¢â‚¬Â-each petition shall comply with the rules of a complaint in an action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This means there must clearly be a stated action, in which this petition failed to provide. GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition which reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Petition for the closure of communications entitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â, sought a remedy, but did not state a cognizable cause of action.  
Especially disturbing was the fact that the petition for injunction and a temporary restraining order, usually reserved for civil suits, was filed in the criminal court.  Essentially it means that the court did not and does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the Liberia Law Revised, Volume 40, in the case of Lamin v. Save the Children fund, the Supreme Court stated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“circuit courts are statutory courts which derive their being and scope of powers from the statues creating them and cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond what is conferred by statute (Lamin et al Save The Children Fund UK, 1996).  The fact that the petition circumvents that fact makes it null and void from its very existence.  

Furthermore, assuming that criminal charges have been levied against the respondents, there has been no writ of summons or arrest issued against them. This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.
The Government also failed to mention the exact penal code the respondents violated.  Once again the fact that such words like petitioner and respondents were used clearly demonstrate that this was a civil matter and the court in this instance lacks jurisdiction over this matter. 
 Liberia Code of Laws Revised, Criminal Procedure Section 14.4 clearly states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The written complaint shall specify the nature of the offense charged and shall contain a concise statement of the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute such offense, and of the time and place of the commission of the offense, and of the time and place of commission of the offense and of the person, if any, against whom, and the thing, if any, in respect to which, the offense was committed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This procedure was not followed.
The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.  The action should be immediately rescinded and the Liberia Government should issue a public apology for this gross violation of fundamental rights.

Having reviewed the merits of the petition, LMC and CEMESP unequivocally condemn governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action to shut down the media outlets as this action clearly infringes on the petitionerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to due process.
While the LMC and CEMESP frown on the spreading of inflammatory rhetorics on the radio and in the newspaper, we are equally alarmed by the arbitrariness of governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions and the Criminal CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal granting of a legally defective petition. In its petition the Government of Liberia failed to state the law that was violated in count three of its petition.
Further, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition was defective as it failed to disclose a concise Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause of action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  According to Civil Procedure Law Section 16.5Ã¢â‚¬Â-each petition shall comply with the rules of a complaint in an action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This means there must clearly be a stated action, in which this petition failed to provide. GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition which reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Petition for the closure of communications entitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â, sought a remedy, but did not state a cognizable cause of action.  
Especially disturbing was the fact that the petition for injunction and a temporary restraining order, usually reserved for civil suits, was filed in the criminal court.  Essentially it means that the court did not and does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the Liberia Law Revised, Volume 40, in the case of Lamin v. Save the Children fund, the Supreme Court stated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“circuit courts are statutory courts which derive their being and scope of powers from the statues creating them and cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond what is conferred by statute (Lamin et al Save The Children Fund UK, 1996).  The fact that the petition circumvents that fact makes it null and void from its very existence.  

Furthermore, assuming that criminal charges have been levied against the respondents, there has been no writ of summons or arrest issued against them. This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.
The Government also failed to mention the exact penal code the respondents violated.  Once again the fact that such words like petitioner and respondents were used clearly demonstrate that this was a civil matter and the court in this instance lacks jurisdiction over this matter. 
 Liberia Code of Laws Revised, Criminal Procedure Section 14.4 clearly states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The written complaint shall specify the nature of the offense charged and shall contain a concise statement of the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute such offense, and of the time and place of the commission of the offense, and of the time and place of commission of the offense and of the person, if any, against whom, and the thing, if any, in respect to which, the offense was committed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This procedure was not followed.
The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.  The action should be immediately rescinded and the Liberia Government should issue a public apology for this gross violation of fundamental rights.

"Liberia challenger warns of turmoil unless poll delayed
Mon Nov 7, 2011 9:51am GMT

By Richard Valdmanis and Alphonso Toweh

MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberia could tip into chaos not seen since its civil war if a presidential run-off election set for Tuesday is not delayed and reorganized, presidential hopeful WinstonTubman said on Sunday.

Tubman, a former United Nations diplomat, was meant to stand against incumbent EllenJohnsonSirleaf in the November 8 run-off but last week withdrew his participation in the process and called for a boycott, citing electoral fraud during the first round of voting last month.

""I think that at the end of the day we will have to evaluate what is likely to be better for the country: delaying the elections or going forward with them in a way that doesn't carry the support of such a big party in the country,""WinstonTubman told Reuters in an interview in the garden of his residence in the capital Monrovia.

""The impact on the region would be huge if we were to descend into chaos again. The whole cycle would begin again, confusion in neighboring countries, people running away, tension in the country. This would be far more costly in the long term than if we were to delay the election for a month.""

International election observers called the October 11 poll mostly free and fair, and the United States, regional bloc ECOWAS and the African Union have all criticizedWinstonTubman's decision to boycott the second round.

Tubman's CDC party has accused Liberia's election commission of ""massive fraud"" during the first-round vote, in whichWinstonTubman took just under 33 percent of the votes toEllenJohnsonSirleaf's nearly 44 percent.

The party said it had evidence that at least three ballot boxes were opened improperly by electoral staff shortly after the vote, and said there were several other inconsistencies that pointed to systematic rigging.

""Calling it massive fraud may be an exaggerated way of talking, but we feel that what happened did not properly reflect the protection of our interests, and we would like to see those interests respected,""WinstonTubman said.

He said he was asking that his party be granted additional access to the vote counting process ""so that we can see what is happening"" and that a run-off be delayed by between two and four weeks to allow time for campaigning.

The election is the West African state's first locally-organized presidential contest since the end of its civil war in 2003, and was meant to be a gauge of the country's progress and to open the door to mine and oil investment.

A demonstration called by the CDC over the weekend failed to attract large-scale support, but the boycott call has raised fears that some of the party's supporters could try to disrupt voting on Tuesday.

The National Election Commission, whose chairman resigned last week under pressure from the CDC, said the vote would go ahead as planned.

Tubman is pushing for a delay and says he has sought but failed to talk directly toEllenJohnsonSirleaf about the issue.

A spokesman forEllenJohnsonSirleaf deniedWinstonTubman had requested a meeting and added ""once he agrees to meet with the president, she will surely welcome him"".

NOT MY CHOICE

Johnson-Sirleaf became Africa's first freely elected female head of state in 2005, and has been internationally praised for reducing debt and maintaining peace in a country devastated by 14-years of fighting that killed up to a quarter of a million people.

But she faces criticism within the country for the slow pace of recovery from the war, with more than half the population still living on less than 50 cents a day and most citizens lacking access to power and water.

Tubman, whose running mate in the election is former soccer star George Weah, said that he felt unable to give in to the broad international pressure to reverse his boycott because it risked radicalizing his mostly young, unemployed supporters.

""I cannot on my own say I am pulling my party into this election on the 8th. If I were to do that before convincing my party that this is the way to go, the result would be worse for the process because my party would no longer be influenced by me and I don't know what influences it would fall under.""

""It could become more extreme, it could become belligerent,"" he said.

Tubman said he was urging his supporters not to resort to violence, but he reaffirmed his refusal to recognise results coming from the election and warned of long-term turmoil.

""We will do everything to be calm, law abiding. But there would be problems, I have to admit. People...who want to invest here would think, well, we better take our money elsewhere because Liberia might explode."" he said.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-07 12:04:12","Yarzeawu Zaza",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"LMC/CEMESP Condemn Govt. Systematic Media Clampdown
Monrovia, Liberia
November 9, 2011
The Liberia Media Center and the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building categorically condemn the Liberia Government for the illegal closure of four broadcast entities in Liberia. 
In a petition filed before the judge of Criminal Court A on November 7, 2011, the state sought the permanent cancellation of the broadcast licenses of the four institutions claiming that the respondents illegally used their respective media outlets to broadcast hate messages against the Government and deliberately disseminated misinformation and messages of violence, instigating the people to rise up and take to the streets, amongst others.
In its petition, the State prayed that the court grant a request for temporary closure of the institutions pending a hearing, and subsequent to the hearing, ordered a permanent closure of Power FM and TV Station, Love FM and TV, Kings FM and Clar TV and Shatta FM.

"STOP THE BLAME GAME!!!

It is preposterous for the cynics and pundits to blame PresidentEllenJohnsonSirleaf for the unfortunate incident on November 7th. .  Moreover, it is also ludicrous to accuse the GOL of censoring the press without analyzing the situation. It is a tragedy for any human being to lose his/her live; equally, it behooves the silent majority on here to know that such situation could have been avoided, had those ROGUE POLITICIANS respected the rule of law.

Democracy comes with a responsibility. The rule of law is one of the important elements of democracy; therefore, in order for such practice to be effective, all parties or stakeholders involved should behave responsibly by respecting the laws. Ironically, democratic principles in Africa are usually undermined by (ROGUE POLITICIANS) and some irresponsible journalists whenever there is an election. 

Having emerged from a bloody uncivil war, it is imperative that politicians steer away from inflammatory acts that have the propensity of igniting another unnecessary violence.  On the other hand, journalists should practice responsible journalism. When you have an irresponsible media reporting erroneous and misleading info that might ignite violence, it is incumbent upon the authority to take necessary actions to mitigate such menace. 

Thank God our brave peace officers were able to respond expeditiously to an incendiary act of violence and hooliganism. Liberia will never ever be subjected to lawlessness and mayhem again!!! Anyone who tries to disrupt the peace and tranquility of Liberia will face the full weight of the law!!! God bless Liberia.

"LMC/CEMESP Condemn Govt. Systematic Media Clampdown
Monrovia, Liberia
November 9, 2011
The Liberia Media Center and the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building categorically condemn the Liberia Government for the illegal closure of four broadcast entities in Liberia. 
In a petition filed before the judge of Criminal Court A on November 7, 2011, the state sought the permanent cancellation of the broadcast licenses of the four institutions claiming that the respondents illegally used their respective media outlets to broadcast hate messages against the Government and deliberately disseminated misinformation and messages of violence, instigating the people to rise up and take to the streets, amongst others.
In its petition, the State prayed that the court grant a request for temporary closure of the institutions pending a hearing, and subsequent to the hearing, ordered a permanent closure of Power FM and TV Station, Love FM and TV, Kings FM and Clar TV and Shatta FM.
Having reviewed the merits of the petition, LMC and CEMESP unequivocally condemn governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action to shut down the media outlets as this action clearly infringes on the petitionerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to due process.
While the LMC and CEMESP frown on the spreading of inflammatory rhetorics on the radio and in the newspaper, we are equally alarmed by the arbitrariness of governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions and the Criminal CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal granting of a legally defective petition. In its petition the Government of Liberia failed to state the law that was violated in count three of its petition.
Further, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition was defective as it failed to disclose a concise Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause of action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  According to Civil Procedure Law Section 16.5Ã¢â‚¬Â-each petition shall comply with the rules of a complaint in an action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This means there must clearly be a stated action, in which this petition failed to provide. GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition which reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Petition for the closure of communications entitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â, sought a remedy, but did not state a cognizable cause of action.  
Especially disturbing was the fact that the petition for injunction and a temporary restraining order, usually reserved for civil suits, was filed in the criminal court.  Essentially it means that the court did not and does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the Liberia Law Revised, Volume 40, in the case of Lamin v. Save the Children fund, the Supreme Court stated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“circuit courts are statutory courts which derive their being and scope of powers from the statues creating them and cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond what is conferred by statute (Lamin et al Save The Children Fund UK, 1996).  The fact that the petition circumvents that fact makes it null and void from its very existence.  

Furthermore, assuming that criminal charges have been levied against the respondents, there has been no writ of summons or arrest issued against them. This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.
The Government also failed to mention the exact penal code the respondents violated.  Once again the fact that such words like petitioner and respondents were used clearly demonstrate that this was a civil matter and the court in this instance lacks jurisdiction over this matter. 
 Liberia Code of Laws Revised, Criminal Procedure Section 14.4 clearly states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The written complaint shall specify the nature of the offense charged and shall contain a concise statement of the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute such offense, and of the time and place of the commission of the offense, and of the time and place of commission of the offense and of the person, if any, against whom, and the thing, if any, in respect to which, the offense was committed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This procedure was not followed.
The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.  The action should be immediately rescinded and the Liberia Government should issue a public apology for this gross violation of fundamental rights.

"LMC/CEMESP Condemn Govt. Systematic Media Clampdown
Monrovia, Liberia
November 9, 2011
The Liberia Media Center and the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building categorically condemn the Liberia Government for the illegal closure of four broadcast entities in Liberia. 
In a petition filed before the judge of Criminal Court A on November 7, 2011, the state sought the permanent cancellation of the broadcast licenses of the four institutions claiming that the respondents illegally used their respective media outlets to broadcast hate messages against the Government and deliberately disseminated misinformation and messages of violence, instigating the people to rise up and take to the streets, amongst others.
In its petition, the State prayed that the court grant a request for temporary closure of the institutions pending a hearing, and subsequent to the hearing, ordered a permanent closure of Power FM and TV Station, Love FM and TV, Kings FM and Clar TV and Shatta FM.
Having reviewed the merits of the petition, LMC and CEMESP unequivocally condemn governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action to shut down the media outlets as this action clearly infringes on the petitionerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to due process.
While the LMC and CEMESP frown on the spreading of inflammatory rhetorics on the radio and in the newspaper, we are equally alarmed by the arbitrariness of governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions and the Criminal CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal granting of a legally defective petition. In its petition the Government of Liberia failed to state the law that was violated in count three of its petition.
Further, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition was defective as it failed to disclose a concise Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause of action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  According to Civil Procedure Law Section 16.5Ã¢â‚¬Â-each petition shall comply with the rules of a complaint in an action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This means there must clearly be a stated action, in which this petition failed to provide. GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition which reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Petition for the closure of communications entitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â, sought a remedy, but did not state a cognizable cause of action.  
Especially disturbing was the fact that the petition for injunction and a temporary restraining order, usually reserved for civil suits, was filed in the criminal court.  Essentially it means that the court did not and does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the Liberia Law Revised, Volume 40, in the case of Lamin v. Save the Children fund, the Supreme Court stated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“circuit courts are statutory courts which derive their being and scope of powers from the statues creating them and cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond what is conferred by statute (Lamin et al Save The Children Fund UK, 1996).  The fact that the petition circumvents that fact makes it null and void from its very existence.  

Furthermore, assuming that criminal charges have been levied against the respondents, there has been no writ of summons or arrest issued against them. This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.
The Government also failed to mention the exact penal code the respondents violated.  Once again the fact that such words like petitioner and respondents were used clearly demonstrate that this was a civil matter and the court in this instance lacks jurisdiction over this matter. 
 Liberia Code of Laws Revised, Criminal Procedure Section 14.4 clearly states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The written complaint shall specify the nature of the offense charged and shall contain a concise statement of the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute such offense, and of the time and place of the commission of the offense, and of the time and place of commission of the offense and of the person, if any, against whom, and the thing, if any, in respect to which, the offense was committed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This procedure was not followed.
The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.  The action should be immediately rescinded and the Liberia Government should issue a public apology for this gross violation of fundamental rights.

"LMC/CEMESP Condemn Govt. Systematic Media Clampdown
Monrovia, Liberia
November 9, 2011
The Liberia Media Center and the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building categorically condemn the Liberia Government for the illegal closure of four broadcast entities in Liberia. 
In a petition filed before the judge of Criminal Court A on November 7, 2011, the state sought the permanent cancellation of the broadcast licenses of the four institutions claiming that the respondents illegally used their respective media outlets to broadcast hate messages against the Government and deliberately disseminated misinformation and messages of violence, instigating the people to rise up and take to the streets, amongst others.
In its petition, the State prayed that the court grant a request for temporary closure of the institutions pending a hearing, and subsequent to the hearing, ordered a permanent closure of Power FM and TV Station, Love FM and TV, Kings FM and Clar TV and Shatta FM.
Having reviewed the merits of the petition, LMC and CEMESP unequivocally condemn governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action to shut down the media outlets as this action clearly infringes on the petitionerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to due process.
While the LMC and CEMESP frown on the spreading of inflammatory rhetorics on the radio and in the newspaper, we are equally alarmed by the arbitrariness of governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions and the Criminal CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal granting of a legally defective petition. In its petition the Government of Liberia failed to state the law that was violated in count three of its petition.
Further, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition was defective as it failed to disclose a concise Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause of action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  According to Civil Procedure Law Section 16.5Ã¢â‚¬Â-each petition shall comply with the rules of a complaint in an action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This means there must clearly be a stated action, in which this petition failed to provide. GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition which reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Petition for the closure of communications entitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â, sought a remedy, but did not state a cognizable cause of action.  
Especially disturbing was the fact that the petition for injunction and a temporary restraining order, usually reserved for civil suits, was filed in the criminal court.  Essentially it means that the court did not and does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the Liberia Law Revised, Volume 40, in the case of Lamin v. Save the Children fund, the Supreme Court stated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“circuit courts are statutory courts which derive their being and scope of powers from the statues creating them and cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond what is conferred by statute (Lamin et al Save The Children Fund UK, 1996).  The fact that the petition circumvents that fact makes it null and void from its very existence.  

Furthermore, assuming that criminal charges have been levied against the respondents, there has been no writ of summons or arrest issued against them. This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.
The Government also failed to mention the exact penal code the respondents violated.  Once again the fact that such words like petitioner and respondents were used clearly demonstrate that this was a civil matter and the court in this instance lacks jurisdiction over this matter. 
 Liberia Code of Laws Revised, Criminal Procedure Section 14.4 clearly states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The written complaint shall specify the nature of the offense charged and shall contain a concise statement of the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute such offense, and of the time and place of the commission of the offense, and of the time and place of commission of the offense and of the person, if any, against whom, and the thing, if any, in respect to which, the offense was committed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This procedure was not followed.
The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.  The action should be immediately rescinded and the Liberia Government should issue a public apology for this gross violation of fundamental rights.

Further, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition was defective as it failed to disclose a concise Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause of action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  According to Civil Procedure Law Section 16.5Ã¢â‚¬Â-each petition shall comply with the rules of a complaint in an action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This means there must clearly be a stated action, in which this petition failed to provide. GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition which reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Petition for the closure of communications entitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â, sought a remedy, but did not state a cognizable cause of action.  
Especially disturbing was the fact that the petition for injunction and a temporary restraining order, usually reserved for civil suits, was filed in the criminal court.  Essentially it means that the court did not and does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the Liberia Law Revised, Volume 40, in the case of Lamin v. Save the Children fund, the Supreme Court stated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“circuit courts are statutory courts which derive their being and scope of powers from the statues creating them and cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond what is conferred by statute (Lamin et al Save The Children Fund UK, 1996).  The fact that the petition circumvents that fact makes it null and void from its very existence.  

Furthermore, assuming that criminal charges have been levied against the respondents, there has been no writ of summons or arrest issued against them. This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.
The Government also failed to mention the exact penal code the respondents violated.  Once again the fact that such words like petitioner and respondents were used clearly demonstrate that this was a civil matter and the court in this instance lacks jurisdiction over this matter. 
 Liberia Code of Laws Revised, Criminal Procedure Section 14.4 clearly states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The written complaint shall specify the nature of the offense charged and shall contain a concise statement of the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute such offense, and of the time and place of the commission of the offense, and of the time and place of commission of the offense and of the person, if any, against whom, and the thing, if any, in respect to which, the offense was committed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This procedure was not followed.
The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.  The action should be immediately rescinded and the Liberia Government should issue a public apology for this gross violation of fundamental rights.

My fellow compatriots, we may have different religions, different tribes, different political ideologies, but we all belong the same country, Liberia. We are Liberia first above everything else. As we close this election season, I would love to extend my hands in peace and unity. Even though the journey may have been rocky, with a lot of political bruises still visible, we just cannot allow this to prevent us from achieving our common goal; the success of mama Liberia. 

This is the time for us to have one end in view, the welfare of Liberia; and let us put aside our differences irrespective of political, tribal, and ideological background to endorse hope over fear. Hence, I am officially disengaging from discussing campaign politics.  It is time to move on, and build us a great nation. IN UNION STRONG, SUCCESS IS SURE.

"LMC/CEMESP Condemn Govt. Systematic Media Clampdown
Monrovia, Liberia
November 9, 2011
The Liberia Media Center and the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building categorically condemn the Liberia Government for the illegal closure of four broadcast entities in Liberia. 
In a petition filed before the judge of Criminal Court A on November 7, 2011, the state sought the permanent cancellation of the broadcast licenses of the four institutions claiming that the respondents illegally used their respective media outlets to broadcast hate messages against the Government and deliberately disseminated misinformation and messages of violence, instigating the people to rise up and take to the streets, amongst others.
In its petition, the State prayed that the court grant a request for temporary closure of the institutions pending a hearing, and subsequent to the hearing, ordered a permanent closure of Power FM and TV Station, Love FM and TV, Kings FM and Clar TV and Shatta FM.
Having reviewed the merits of the petition, LMC and CEMESP unequivocally condemn governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action to shut down the media outlets as this action clearly infringes on the petitionerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to due process.
While the LMC and CEMESP frown on the spreading of inflammatory rhetorics on the radio and in the newspaper, we are equally alarmed by the arbitrariness of governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions and the Criminal CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal granting of a legally defective petition.

"LMC/CEMESP Condemn Govt. Systematic Media Clampdown
Monrovia, Liberia
November 9, 2011
The Liberia Media Center and the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building categorically condemn the Liberia Government for the illegal closure of four broadcast entities in Liberia. 
In a petition filed before the judge of Criminal Court A on November 7, 2011, the state sought the permanent cancellation of the broadcast licenses of the four institutions claiming that the respondents illegally used their respective media outlets to broadcast hate messages against the Government and deliberately disseminated misinformation and messages of violence, instigating the people to rise up and take to the streets, amongst others.
In its petition, the State prayed that the court grant a request for temporary closure of the institutions pending a hearing, and subsequent to the hearing, ordered a permanent closure of Power FM and TV Station, Love FM and TV, Kings FM and Clar TV and Shatta FM.
Having reviewed the merits of the petition, LMC and CEMESP unequivocally condemn governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action to shut down the media outlets as this action clearly infringes on the petitionerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to due process.
While the LMC and CEMESP frown on the spreading of inflammatory rhetorics on the radio and in the newspaper, we are equally alarmed by the arbitrariness of governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions and the Criminal CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal granting of a legally defective petition. In its petition the Government of Liberia failed to state the law that was violated in count three of its petition.
Further, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition was defective as it failed to disclose a concise Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause of action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  According to Civil Procedure Law Section 16.5Ã¢â‚¬Â-each petition shall comply with the rules of a complaint in an action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This means there must clearly be a stated action, in which this petition failed to provide. GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition which reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Petition for the closure of communications entitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â, sought a remedy, but did not state a cognizable cause of action.  
Especially disturbing was the fact that the petition for injunction and a temporary restraining order, usually reserved for civil suits, was filed in the criminal court.  Essentially it means that the court did not and does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the Liberia Law Revised, Volume 40, in the case of Lamin v. Save the Children fund, the Supreme Court stated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“circuit courts are statutory courts which derive their being and scope of powers from the statues creating them and cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond what is conferred by statute (Lamin et al Save The Children Fund UK, 1996).  The fact that the petition circumvents that fact makes it null and void from its very existence.  

Furthermore, assuming that criminal charges have been levied against the respondents, there has been no writ of summons or arrest issued against them. This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.
The Government also failed to mention the exact penal code the respondents violated.  Once again the fact that such words like petitioner and respondents were used clearly demonstrate that this was a civil matter and the court in this instance lacks jurisdiction over this matter. 
 Liberia Code of Laws Revised, Criminal Procedure Section 14.4 clearly states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The written complaint shall specify the nature of the offense charged and shall contain a concise statement of the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute such offense, and of the time and place of the commission of the offense, and of the time and place of commission of the offense and of the person, if any, against whom, and the thing, if any, in respect to which, the offense was committed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This procedure was not followed.
The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.  The action should be immediately rescinded and the Liberia Government should issue a public apology for this gross violation of fundamental rights.

Three weeks ago, FrontPageAfrica received some information that Mr. George Weah, Vice Standard Bearer of the Congress for Democratic Change was arrested in May this year in the U.S. state of Georgia suburban area, Douglas County, and charged with driving while license suspended or revoked(Miscl) and failure to stop at a stop sign.

Weah was booked and an informer provided FrontPageAfrica with the arrest Mug Shot detailing Mr. WeahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inmate number as A69806; Race Black, Sex Male, Age of booking at 44, address 1313 NW 139 Terrace Pembrrook Pine, Fl. 33028. The arrest date is listed as 05/09/2011 at 1:47am.

The county SheriffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office informed FrontPageAfrica when contacted recently that the case against Mr. Weah had been transferred to the Douglas County State Court. Ã¢â‚¬Å“He is not in our jail anymore,Ã¢â‚¬Â a representative at the court told FrontPageAfrica.  The official declined to state how long Mr. Weah spent in the county jail but only added that the matter was forwarded to the county court for trial.

Jannissa Miller, a Clerk at the county court when contacted Wednesday, confirmed WeahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s case number and added that Mr. Weah is due to appear in court next year.

"My special thanks to the many Liberia who risked their security to participate in deciding their future in the runoff election. I like to join US President Barack Obama in calling on Security forces in Liberia to exercise maximum restraint and to allow peaceful protest.  I also like to call on the United Nations mission in Liberia and the Liberia Government to constitute an independent investigation of the CDC March 7 protest exploring the legality of the protest and excessive use of force by the security forces which led to the death of three persons.  I implore the CDC to refrain from accepting its legislative seats won in the just ended election as it will be hypocritical and a disservice to its supporters and the Liberia nation to cite improprieties in the electoral process, stage a tragic protest, abort the runoff, and form part of government brought to power by claims of flaw. To the GOL, I appeal for a speedy and impartial judicial hearing into the issues which led to the closure of three media houses.  To PresidentEllenJohnsonSirleaf, please note that you are about to preside over a deeply divided country as evident by events surrounding this election. It is imperative that the government endeavor to undertake a reconciliation program to unite the nation. Perhaps, it is time we re-review the recommendations of the TRC.  I like to end by calling on the young people, the future of our nation, not to allow their judgment to be clouded by political loyalty, their persons to be used for destabilization, but as vehicles of change. This we must do by objectively tackling the issues that are affecting our nation. It is no crime to disagree with a president you support, a party you are loyal to, or a person you admire.  The NEW Liberia must be built on honesty, objectivity, and above all patriotism. NO ONE OR GROUP IS GREATER THAN LIBERIA. FOR TOO LONG WE HAVE GIVEN OUR ALLEGIANCES TO PERSONALITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS.

Let us remember our youth and how impressionable we were.  These children need to be groomed and molded into productive citizens, and not become hooligans throwing rocks.  This solves nothing.

Three weeks ago, FrontPageAfrica received some information that Mr. George Weah, Vice Standard Bearer of the Congress for Democratic Change was arrested in May this year in the U.S. state of Georgia suburban area, Douglas County, and charged with driving while license suspended or revoked(Miscl) and failure to stop at a stop sign.

Weah was booked and an informer provided FrontPageAfrica with the arrest Mug Shot detailing Mr. WeahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inmate number as A69806; Race Black, Sex Male, Age of booking at 44, address 1313 NW 139 Terrace Pembrrook Pine, Fl. 33028. The arrest date is listed as 05/09/2011 at 1:47am.

The county SheriffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office informed FrontPageAfrica when contacted recently that the case against Mr. Weah had been transferred to the Douglas County State Court. Ã¢â‚¬Å“He is not in our jail anymore,Ã¢â‚¬Â a representative at the court told FrontPageAfrica.  The official declined to state how long Mr. Weah spent in the county jail but only added that the matter was forwarded to the county court for trial.

Jannissa Miller, a Clerk at the county court when contacted Wednesday, confirmed WeahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s case number and added that Mr. Weah is due to appear in court next year. Asked for specifics, Miller said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Right now it is listed for January but that could change depending on lawyers or the judge.Ã¢â‚¬Â

I regret the lost of lives during the protest/demonstration/peaceful match or maybe peaceful demonstration. I equally sympathize with Mr. George Kailando for the looting of his properties. I sympathize with those peaceful non CDCians and non military persons who vehicles and other properties were destroyed. I say sorry to those peaceful citizens whose movements were restricted by road blocks placed by "" peaceful demonstrators""  infront of the CDC headquater. why are people only talking about the boy who lost his live and thinking that the looting of Mr. kailondo;s property was right? Why are we not talking about those who were denied passage infront of the CDC headquater because of the road blocks? Why are we blinding our minds to the plight of those whose vehicles were damage and not by security people. Let me let you know that people were victimized, many people were victimized. While it is true that the death of the CDCian is of great concern, I'm  equally concern with other victms who suffered because some people were exercising some "" right to assemble"". While it is true that a part of the constitution gives right to peaceful assembly, the constitution also ask that you get permit from the government. While many may think that CDC's action was not a campaign, let us not forget that CDC is a political party and not a church group and these are political times. Getting in the street in the name of peaceful assembly to express anything relative to the election in Liberia was a form of campaign and the laws were clear that campaign was closed. Leaving all those days of campaign and selecting the day you were not to get to the street, was provocative and it was pushing somebody to the wall. fellow Liberia, let us say no to violence and stop doing things that will create the worst case scenario ( DEATH ) just because we want to have reason for saying that somebody is a bad person. a bad person is not a reall bad person when he is pushed to the wall and doing bad becomes a remedy.

"LMC/CEMESP Condemn Govt. Systematic Media Clampdown
Monrovia, Liberia
November 9, 2011
The Liberia Media Center and the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building categorically condemn the Liberia Government for the illegal closure of four broadcast entities in Liberia. 
In a petition filed before the judge of Criminal Court A on November 7, 2011, the state sought the permanent cancellation of the broadcast licenses of the four institutions claiming that the respondents illegally used their respective media outlets to broadcast hate messages against the Government and deliberately disseminated misinformation and messages of violence, instigating the people to rise up and take to the streets, amongst others.
In its petition, the State prayed that the court grant a request for temporary closure of the institutions pending a hearing, and subsequent to the hearing, ordered a permanent closure of Power FM and TV Station, Love FM and TV, Kings FM and Clar TV and Shatta FM.
Having reviewed the merits of the petition, LMC and CEMESP unequivocally condemn governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action to shut down the media outlets as this action clearly infringes on the petitionerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to due process.
While the LMC and CEMESP frown on the spreading of inflammatory rhetorics on the radio and in the newspaper, we are equally alarmed by the arbitrariness of governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions and the Criminal CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal granting of a legally defective petition. In its petition the Government of Liberia failed to state the law that was violated in count three of its petition.
Further, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition was defective as it failed to disclose a concise Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause of action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  According to Civil Procedure Law Section 16.5Ã¢â‚¬Â-each petition shall comply with the rules of a complaint in an action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This means there must clearly be a stated action, in which this petition failed to provide. GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition which reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Petition for the closure of communications entitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â, sought a remedy, but did not state a cognizable cause of action.  
Especially disturbing was the fact that the petition for injunction and a temporary restraining order, usually reserved for civil suits, was filed in the criminal court.  Essentially it means that the court did not and does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the Liberia Law Revised, Volume 40, in the case of Lamin v. Save the Children fund, the Supreme Court stated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“circuit courts are statutory courts which derive their being and scope of powers from the statues creating them and cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond what is conferred by statute (Lamin et al Save The Children Fund UK, 1996).  The fact that the petition circumvents that fact makes it null and void from its very existence.  

Furthermore, assuming that criminal charges have been levied against the respondents, there has been no writ of summons or arrest issued against them. This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.
The Government also failed to mention the exact penal code the respondents violated.  Once again the fact that such words like petitioner and respondents were used clearly demonstrate that this was a civil matter and the court in this instance lacks jurisdiction over this matter. 
 Liberia Code of Laws Revised, Criminal Procedure Section 14.4 clearly states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The written complaint shall specify the nature of the offense charged and shall contain a concise statement of the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute such offense, and of the time and place of the commission of the offense, and of the time and place of commission of the offense and of the person, if any, against whom, and the thing, if any, in respect to which, the offense was committed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This procedure was not followed.
The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.  The action should be immediately rescinded and the Liberia Government should issue a public apology for this gross violation of fundamental rights.

"LMC/CEMESP Condemn Govt. Systematic Media Clampdown
Monrovia, Liberia
November 9, 2011
The Liberia Media Center and the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building categorically condemn the Liberia Government for the illegal closure of four broadcast entities in Liberia. 
In a petition filed before the judge of Criminal Court A on November 7, 2011, the state sought the permanent cancellation of the broadcast licenses of the four institutions claiming that the respondents illegally used their respective media outlets to broadcast hate messages against the Government and deliberately disseminated misinformation and messages of violence, instigating the people to rise up and take to the streets, amongst others.
In its petition, the State prayed that the court grant a request for temporary closure of the institutions pending a hearing, and subsequent to the hearing, ordered a permanent closure of Power FM and TV Station, Love FM and TV, Kings FM and Clar TV and Shatta FM.
Having reviewed the merits of the petition, LMC and CEMESP unequivocally condemn governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action to shut down the media outlets as this action clearly infringes on the petitionerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to due process.
While the LMC and CEMESP frown on the spreading of inflammatory rhetorics on the radio and in the newspaper, we are equally alarmed by the arbitrariness of governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions and the Criminal CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal granting of a legally defective petition. In its petition the Government of Liberia failed to state the law that was violated in count three of its petition.
Further, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition was defective as it failed to disclose a concise Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause of action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  According to Civil Procedure Law Section 16.5Ã¢â‚¬Â-each petition shall comply with the rules of a complaint in an action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This means there must clearly be a stated action, in which this petition failed to provide. GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition which reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Petition for the closure of communications entitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â, sought a remedy, but did not state a cognizable cause of action.  
Especially disturbing was the fact that the petition for injunction and a temporary restraining order, usually reserved for civil suits, was filed in the criminal court.  Essentially it means that the court did not and does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the Liberia Law Revised, Volume 40, in the case of Lamin v. Save the Children fund, the Supreme Court stated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“circuit courts are statutory courts which derive their being and scope of powers from the statues creating them and cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond what is conferred by statute (Lamin et al Save The Children Fund UK, 1996).  The fact that the petition circumvents that fact makes it null and void from its very existence.  

Furthermore, assuming that criminal charges have been levied against the respondents, there has been no writ of summons or arrest issued against them. This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.
The Government also failed to mention the exact penal code the respondents violated.  Once again the fact that such words like petitioner and respondents were used clearly demonstrate that this was a civil matter and the court in this instance lacks jurisdiction over this matter. 
 Liberia Code of Laws Revised, Criminal Procedure Section 14.4 clearly states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The written complaint shall specify the nature of the offense charged and shall contain a concise statement of the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute such offense, and of the time and place of the commission of the offense, and of the time and place of commission of the offense and of the person, if any, against whom, and the thing, if any, in respect to which, the offense was committed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This procedure was not followed.
The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.  The action should be immediately rescinded and the Liberia Government should issue a public apology for this gross violation of fundamental rights.

"LMC/CEMESP Condemn Govt. Systematic Media Clampdown
Monrovia, Liberia
November 9, 2011
The Liberia Media Center and the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building categorically condemn the Liberia Government for the illegal closure of four broadcast entities in Liberia. 
In a petition filed before the judge of Criminal Court A on November 7, 2011, the state sought the permanent cancellation of the broadcast licenses of the four institutions claiming that the respondents illegally used their respective media outlets to broadcast hate messages against the Government and deliberately disseminated misinformation and messages of violence, instigating the people to rise up and take to the streets, amongst others.
In its petition, the State prayed that the court grant a request for temporary closure of the institutions pending a hearing, and subsequent to the hearing, ordered a permanent closure of Power FM and TV Station, Love FM and TV, Kings FM and Clar TV and Shatta FM.
Having reviewed the merits of the petition, LMC and CEMESP unequivocally condemn governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action to shut down the media outlets as this action clearly infringes on the petitionerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to due process.
While the LMC and CEMESP frown on the spreading of inflammatory rhetorics on the radio and in the newspaper, we are equally alarmed by the arbitrariness of governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions and the Criminal CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal granting of a legally defective petition. In its petition the Government of Liberia failed to state the law that was violated in count three of its petition.
Further, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition was defective as it failed to disclose a concise Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause of action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  According to Civil Procedure Law Section 16.5Ã¢â‚¬Â-each petition shall comply with the rules of a complaint in an action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This means there must clearly be a stated action, in which this petition failed to provide. GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition which reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Petition for the closure of communications entitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â, sought a remedy, but did not state a cognizable cause of action.  
Especially disturbing was the fact that the petition for injunction and a temporary restraining order, usually reserved for civil suits, was filed in the criminal court.  Essentially it means that the court did not and does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the Liberia Law Revised, Volume 40, in the case of Lamin v. Save the Children fund, the Supreme Court stated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“circuit courts are statutory courts which derive their being and scope of powers from the statues creating them and cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond what is conferred by statute (Lamin et al Save The Children Fund UK, 1996).  The fact that the petition circumvents that fact makes it null and void from its very existence.  

Furthermore, assuming that criminal charges have been levied against the respondents, there has been no writ of summons or arrest issued against them. This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.
The Government also failed to mention the exact penal code the respondents violated.  Once again the fact that such words like petitioner and respondents were used clearly demonstrate that this was a civil matter and the court in this instance lacks jurisdiction over this matter. 
 Liberia Code of Laws Revised, Criminal Procedure Section 14.4 clearly states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The written complaint shall specify the nature of the offense charged and shall contain a concise statement of the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute such offense, and of the time and place of the commission of the offense, and of the time and place of commission of the offense and of the person, if any, against whom, and the thing, if any, in respect to which, the offense was committed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This procedure was not followed.
The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.

"Weah Arrested; Trial Set for January

Three weeks ago, FrontPageAfrica received some information that Mr. George Weah, Vice Standard Bearer of the Congress for Democratic Change was arrested in May this year in the U.S. state of Georgia suburban area, Douglas County, and charged with driving while license suspended or revoked(Miscl) and failure to stop at a stop sign.

Weah was booked and an informer provided FrontPageAfrica with the arrest Mug Shot detailing Mr. WeahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inmate number as A69806; Race Black, Sex Male, Age of booking at 44, address 1313 NW 139 Terrace Pembrrook Pine, Fl. 33028. The arrest date is listed as 05/09/2011 at 1:47am.

The county SheriffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office informed FrontPageAfrica when contacted recently that the case against Mr. Weah had been transferred to the Douglas County State Court. Ã¢â‚¬Å“He is not in our jail anymore,Ã¢â‚¬Â a representative at the court told FrontPageAfrica.  The official declined to state how long Mr. Weah spent in the county jail but only added that the matter was forwarded to the county court for trial.

Jannissa Miller, a Clerk at the county court when contacted Wednesday, confirmed WeahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s case number and added that Mr. Weah is due to appear in court next year. Asked for specifics, Miller said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Right now it is listed for January but that could change depending on lawyers or the judge.Ã¢â‚¬Â

FrontPageAfrica was not able to confirm how long Mr. Weah spent in the county jail and when he was bailed out or who bailed him out of jail.

The Liberia Media Center and the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building categorically condemn the Liberia Government for the illegal closure of four broadcast entities in Liberia.

The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.

"Stephen, it is my second time mentioning this. I have over and again, that stations airing inflammatory rhetorics in no help to foster the peace. Kings FM especially have had serious issues with us and even now. The point is, when you reach that tipping point as a government whether to close or not to close, you must consider a lot of things including parity of punishment. As you do not want skpetics to question the intent of your action, you must be pretty sure that it meets tha balance test. That said, as moderate as Power FM, it was closed, so the question rings, what about Truth. SO, it I was in that position, and I must keep the peace, I will ensure the toxic entities are dealt with consistent with law and without exception. But, we can not afford to use illegal means to satisfy legal ends.

"Is this blind loyalty or love at all cost on the part of some Liberia ? If it was wrong in Samuel Doe's time, Taylor's time, it is surely wrong now inEllenJohnsonSirleaf's. So you think these youths of Liberia (mythys) were killed because they were folled byWinstonTubman and Weah ? How were they fooled, just thinking aloud ? Through a free peaceful assembly ? What are the rules of engaement ? Lets play the devil's advocate and agreed the assembly was wrong; was it right to gun down people, citizens of Liberia because they dared to assembled peacefully ? So death is the sentence now in Liberia when people defied government in a public demostration ? How can any body even attempt to justify this ? is this how we now defend the public peace ? Were these not the same crimes we all fought against yesterday ? The leaders in Liberia today fermented war yesterday in which hundreds of thousands died to address issues they felt strongly against, issues completely the same as is unfolding today, the murdering of the innocents in our country, and people want to justify this ? How do you called what happened on monday, how would you describe it ? What again are the rules of engagement in instances like we witnessed in Liberia on monday ? I am no security personnel, but I know from my studies that you dont use live aminnition at a demostration of unarmed people, even if these people are throwing stones, which in this case did not happen prior to the shootings. Tear gas, is the first response; wipps, water canons' sprayings, to the extreme, the use of rubber bullets; but shots fired, deadly force ? resulting in the death of many, especially Liberia youths ? Well, what path is Liberia treading, a path of peace ? Do you think it is possible in this day and age to subdue people, suppress their thought process through these kinds of murders ? Dont even talk about reconciliation; How can we fix this ? This is a very very grave situation, this is not ordinary platform talk, people died and people are dying as we speak from bullet wounds fired by the Liberia National Police. Say what you may, but this will not lead us to peace anytime soon; besides who ordered these shootings, the discharged of live weapons, ammunitions ? It had to come from the top; and ofcourse there are and will be repercussions. There must be an independent Investigation launched by the United Nations, Amnesty International and other well meaning credible  international groups to ascertain exactly what happened on monday, who instigated what, the rule of law attending, the rules of engagement; who did what, who ordered the killings; so that Liberia can make amends and move forward. We all yearn for peace, but lets be honest, can there ever be peace, real lasting, genuine peace in the absense of justice ? Real lasting peace when other peoples lve ones are murdered in cold blood, what is their crime, just for assembling peacefully to stage a demostration ? HELLO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"LMC/CEMESP Condemn Govt. Systematic Media Clampdown
Monrovia, Liberia
November 9, 2011
The Liberia Media Center and the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building categorically condemn the Liberia Government for the illegal closure of four broadcast entities in Liberia. 
In a petition filed before the judge of Criminal Court A on November 7, 2011, the state sought the permanent cancellation of the broadcast licenses of the four institutions claiming that the respondents illegally used their respective media outlets to broadcast hate messages against the Government and deliberately disseminated misinformation and messages of violence, instigating the people to rise up and take to the streets, amongst others.
In its petition, the State prayed that the court grant a request for temporary closure of the institutions pending a hearing, and subsequent to the hearing, ordered a permanent closure of Power FM and TV Station, Love FM and TV, Kings FM and Clar TV and Shatta FM.
Having reviewed the merits of the petition, LMC and CEMESP unequivocally condemn governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action to shut down the media outlets as this action clearly infringes on the petitionerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to due process.
While the LMC and CEMESP frown on the spreading of inflammatory rhetorics on the radio and in the newspaper, we are equally alarmed by the arbitrariness of governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions and the Criminal CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal granting of a legally defective petition. In its petition the Government of Liberia failed to state the law that was violated in count three of its petition.
Further, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition was defective as it failed to disclose a concise Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause of action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  According to Civil Procedure Law Section 16.5Ã¢â‚¬Â-each petition shall comply with the rules of a complaint in an action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This means there must clearly be a stated action, in which this petition failed to provide. GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition which reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Petition for the closure of communications entitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â, sought a remedy, but did not state a cognizable cause of action.  
Especially disturbing was the fact that the petition for injunction and a temporary restraining order, usually reserved for civil suits, was filed in the criminal court.  Essentially it means that the court did not and does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the Liberia Law Revised, Volume 40, in the case of Lamin v. Save the Children fund, the Supreme Court stated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“circuit courts are statutory courts which derive their being and scope of powers from the statues creating them and cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond what is conferred by statute (Lamin et al Save The Children Fund UK, 1996).  The fact that the petition circumvents that fact makes it null and void from its very existence.  

Furthermore, assuming that criminal charges have been levied against the respondents, there has been no writ of summons or arrest issued against them. This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.

The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.  The action should be immediately rescinded and the Liberia Government should issue a public apology for this gross violation of fundamental rights.

"LMC/CEMESP Condemn Govt. Systematic Media Clampdown
Monrovia, Liberia
November 9, 2011
The Liberia Media Center and the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building categorically condemn the Liberia Government for the illegal closure of four broadcast entities in Liberia. 
In a petition filed before the judge of Criminal Court A on November 7, 2011, the state sought the permanent cancellation of the broadcast licenses of the four institutions claiming that the respondents illegally used their respective media outlets to broadcast hate messages against the Government and deliberately disseminated misinformation and messages of violence, instigating the people to rise up and take to the streets, amongst others.
In its petition, the State prayed that the court grant a request for temporary closure of the institutions pending a hearing, and subsequent to the hearing, ordered a permanent closure of Power FM and TV Station, Love FM and TV, Kings FM and Clar TV and Shatta FM.
Having reviewed the merits of the petition, LMC and CEMESP unequivocally condemn governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action to shut down the media outlets as this action clearly infringes on the petitionerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to due process.
While the LMC and CEMESP frown on the spreading of inflammatory rhetorics on the radio and in the newspaper, we are equally alarmed by the arbitrariness of governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions and the Criminal CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal granting of a legally defective petition. In its petition the Government of Liberia failed to state the law that was violated in count three of its petition.
Further, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition was defective as it failed to disclose a concise Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause of action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  According to Civil Procedure Law Section 16.5Ã¢â‚¬Â-each petition shall comply with the rules of a complaint in an action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This means there must clearly be a stated action, in which this petition failed to provide. GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition which reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Petition for the closure of communications entitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â, sought a remedy, but did not state a cognizable cause of action.  
Especially disturbing was the fact that the petition for injunction and a temporary restraining order, usually reserved for civil suits, was filed in the criminal court.  Essentially it means that the court did not and does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the Liberia Law Revised, Volume 40, in the case of Lamin v. Save the Children fund, the Supreme Court stated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“circuit courts are statutory courts which derive their being and scope of powers from the statues creating them and cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond what is conferred by statute (Lamin et al Save The Children Fund UK, 1996).  The fact that the petition circumvents that fact makes it null and void from its very existence.  

Furthermore, assuming that criminal charges have been levied against the respondents, there has been no writ of summons or arrest issued against them. This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.
The Government also failed to mention the exact penal code the respondents violated.  Once again the fact that such words like petitioner and respondents were used clearly demonstrate that this was a civil matter and the court in this instance lacks jurisdiction over this matter. 
 Liberia Code of Laws Revised, Criminal Procedure Section 14.4 clearly states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The written complaint shall specify the nature of the offense charged and shall contain a concise statement of the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute such offense, and of the time and place of the commission of the offense, and of the time and place of commission of the offense and of the person, if any, against whom, and the thing, if any, in respect to which, the offense was committed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This procedure was not followed.
The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.  The action should be immediately rescinded and the Liberia Government should issue a public apology for this gross violation of fundamental rights.

"Liberia will never become a one party state, just remove that from your thought processes. Everybody in Liberia cannot ever belong to one party; if that happens we will not be talking democracy my people. Democracy means variety, plurality, it certainly does not mean enmity. As it is now in Liberia, once you are not a Unity Party supporter or sympathiser you an enemy of the state, no good, no brains. This will not and cannot continue. I am not a Unity Party partisan, I am a Cdcian, if that makes me an enemy of the state so be it. But Have I broken any law or laws of the republic, why are people looking at me as an enemy of the state ? Being a member of the Congress for Democratic Change means I am not a good law abiding citizen, does it mean I am not voting wisely, does being a member of the Congress for Democratic Change means I am not thinking wisely, or that I am not equally as other Liberia concern about the future of my children and that of my community, and/or my country ? Are you serious when you say once i preferred the CDC, means i am not voting wisely ? These are the foolishness that comes from the mouths of myopic Liberia with the audacity to think that if you are CDC, then you must be a trouble maker; can you imagine this venom ? Well, I am sorry folks if this is your brand of democracy, I would not have any part of it. Now, when WinstonTubman said during the campaign that his government would not prioritize press freedom, everybody bashed him; eventhough he said he was taken out of context, he was still bashed massively by Liberia of all pursuasions. Today, three pradio and telivision facilities were shut down in Liberia under the cover of darkness at about half past 11pm by armed police of the government of Liberia for ""hate  speech"" according to government sources. Hypocritical, I would say; Hypocritical, yes. How can you shut down radio facilities because in your mind they have alternative views for those of those totting exclusively your line. A week ago a print meduim published a story naming with attending pictures credible Liberia deemed as enemies of peace in Liberia, trouble makers; endangering the lives of these Liberia as a result; this magazine was never closed by government; Truth FM Radio, another meduim of hate speech totting government line 100% is still on the air blabbing hate language and false information, they nevertheless remains on the airwaves of Liberia. How selective can you be, government, in applying justice ? The rule of law cannot be applied selectively, justice is suppose to be blind, thats the true intend and spirit of the law, the courts, etc. Now, in Liberia there is a travesty going on and peaple are attempting to justify this only because they have a piece of job to protect ? Liberia is bigger than all of us if it was wrong yesterday, what makes it right today ? Can peace ever be attain anywhere without some semblance of justice ? Liberia is once again sliding on a slippery slope; all because those who lead want to show that they are iron this, and iron that; well, listen, the time for iron anything is in the past; the application of the law is an across the board situation, it can never be selective; you do it like that you will be found wanting, and mark my word, YOU WILL BE FOUND WANTING; THE DAY OF RECONNING IS UPON US SHORTLY.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-10 03:21:18","Toga Nimely",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"LMC/CEMESP Condemn Govt. Systematic Media Clampdown
Monrovia, Liberia
November 9, 2011
The Liberia Media Center and the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building categorically condemn the Liberia Government for the illegal closure of four broadcast entities in Liberia. 
In a petition filed before the judge of Criminal Court A on November 7, 2011, the state sought the permanent cancellation of the broadcast licenses of the four institutions claiming that the respondents illegally used their respective media outlets to broadcast hate messages against the Government and deliberately disseminated misinformation and messages of violence, instigating the people to rise up and take to the streets, amongst others.
In its petition, the State prayed that the court grant a request for temporary closure of the institutions pending a hearing, and subsequent to the hearing, ordered a permanent closure of Power FM and TV Station, Love FM and TV, Kings FM and Clar TV and Shatta FM.
Having reviewed the merits of the petition, LMC and CEMESP unequivocally condemn governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action to shut down the media outlets as this action clearly infringes on the petitionerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to due process.
While the LMC and CEMESP frown on the spreading of inflammatory rhetorics on the radio and in the newspaper, we are equally alarmed by the arbitrariness of governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions and the Criminal CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal granting of a legally defective petition. In its petition the Government of Liberia failed to state the law that was violated in count three of its petition.
Further, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition was defective as it failed to disclose a concise Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause of action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  According to Civil Procedure Law Section 16.5Ã¢â‚¬Â-each petition shall comply with the rules of a complaint in an action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This means there must clearly be a stated action, in which this petition failed to provide. GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition which reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Petition for the closure of communications entitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â, sought a remedy, but did not state a cognizable cause of action.  
Especially disturbing was the fact that the petition for injunction and a temporary restraining order, usually reserved for civil suits, was filed in the criminal court.  Essentially it means that the court did not and does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the Liberia Law Revised, Volume 40, in the case of Lamin v. Save the Children fund, the Supreme Court stated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“circuit courts are statutory courts which derive their being and scope of powers from the statues creating them and cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond what is conferred by statute (Lamin et al Save The Children Fund UK, 1996).  The fact that the petition circumvents that fact makes it null and void from its very existence.  

Furthermore, assuming that criminal charges have been levied against the respondents, there has been no writ of summons or arrest issued against them. This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.
The Government also failed to mention the exact penal code the respondents violated.  Once again the fact that such words like petitioner and respondents were used clearly demonstrate that this was a civil matter and the court in this instance lacks jurisdiction over this matter. 
 Liberia Code of Laws Revised, Criminal Procedure Section 14.4 clearly states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The written complaint shall specify the nature of the offense charged and shall contain a concise statement of the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute such offense, and of the time and place of the commission of the offense, and of the time and place of commission of the offense and of the person, if any, against whom, and the thing, if any, in respect to which, the offense was committed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This procedure was not followed.
The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.  The action should be immediately rescinded and the Liberia Government should issue a public apology for this gross violation of fundamental rights.

"LMC/CEMESP Condemn Govt. Systematic Media Clampdown
Monrovia, Liberia
November 9, 2011
The Liberia Media Center and the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building categorically condemn the Liberia Government for the illegal closure of four broadcast entities in Liberia. 
In a petition filed before the judge of Criminal Court A on November 7, 2011, the state sought the permanent cancellation of the broadcast licenses of the four institutions claiming that the respondents illegally used their respective media outlets to broadcast hate messages against the Government and deliberately disseminated misinformation and messages of violence, instigating the people to rise up and take to the streets, amongst others.
In its petition, the State prayed that the court grant a request for temporary closure of the institutions pending a hearing, and subsequent to the hearing, ordered a permanent closure of Power FM and TV Station, Love FM and TV, Kings FM and Clar TV and Shatta FM.
Having reviewed the merits of the petition, LMC and CEMESP unequivocally condemn governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action to shut down the media outlets as this action clearly infringes on the petitionerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to due process.
While the LMC and CEMESP frown on the spreading of inflammatory rhetorics on the radio and in the newspaper, we are equally alarmed by the arbitrariness of governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions and the Criminal CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal granting of a legally defective petition. In its petition the Government of Liberia failed to state the law that was violated in count three of its petition.
Further, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition was defective as it failed to disclose a concise Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause of action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  According to Civil Procedure Law Section 16.5Ã¢â‚¬Â-each petition shall comply with the rules of a complaint in an action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This means there must clearly be a stated action, in which this petition failed to provide. GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition which reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Petition for the closure of communications entitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â, sought a remedy, but did not state a cognizable cause of action.  
Especially disturbing was the fact that the petition for injunction and a temporary restraining order, usually reserved for civil suits, was filed in the criminal court.  Essentially it means that the court did not and does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the Liberia Law Revised, Volume 40, in the case of Lamin v. Save the Children fund, the Supreme Court stated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“circuit courts are statutory courts which derive their being and scope of powers from the statues creating them and cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond what is conferred by statute (Lamin et al Save The Children Fund UK, 1996).  The fact that the petition circumvents that fact makes it null and void from its very existence.  

Furthermore, assuming that criminal charges have been levied against the respondents, there has been no writ of summons or arrest issued against them. This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.
The Government also failed to mention the exact penal code the respondents violated.  Once again the fact that such words like petitioner and respondents were used clearly demonstrate that this was a civil matter and the court in this instance lacks jurisdiction over this matter. 
 Liberia Code of Laws Revised, Criminal Procedure Section 14.4 clearly states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The written complaint shall specify the nature of the offense charged and shall contain a concise statement of the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute such offense, and of the time and place of the commission of the offense, and of the time and place of commission of the offense and of the person, if any, against whom, and the thing, if any, in respect to which, the offense was committed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This procedure was not followed.
The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.  The action should be immediately rescinded and the Liberia Government should issue a public apology for this gross violation of fundamental rights.

A family member and a friend were hurt during the riot (before the incidence between the LNP, UNMIL and the rioters) but they havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gone on radio stations to say anything. Other people were victimized but everybody is only addressing the issue of death of three (?) rioters (CDCians) and some injured rioters. No one is concerned about those whose properties were destroyed but wants investigation for some foolish kids who irrational behaviors led to the death of a young man and some seriously injured members of the CDC. I also learned that some members of the ERU, LNP were injured in the process. So what was said about that? Nothing! I am discontented that the whole scenario escalated into the death of three young people (?) but what can I do? The entire situation was preventable but they chose to take matters into their hands with mandate from the party authority without second thought that something sinister could have occurred.

"I do not know the point of contention here. I am gathering that hate speeches in the electoral process is something we should not tolerate because it has the potential to induce violence. If we agree on this point then it is improper to close one station that preaches hate messages and leave another open to continue with hate messages. That said, we should hail the government for closing the three stations initially and press forward for the closure of the remaining stations preaching hate messages. But it would be a weak argument to state that because the others are not closed, so the government should allow all to preach the hate messages. This is unacceptable. Remember it is the gvernment that has to make the closure decisions and not the LP, CDC or any individual. Just as if the CDC was the ruling party, it would be the one clothed with the authority to do same. One hard fact which many people find difficult to hold is when a government is in power,
 all of its decisions will not be liked by everyone. Toga worked for one of the most brutal regimes in Liberia's history and they did what they could from their vintage point. If you ask him now, he will justify every action of the government including the stealing of public funds which he used to build himself a mansion in no time. No one wants to chose a party for you. You have your right as a being to even pursue stupidity if you wish to. But, you have limitations so that you do not infringe on the rights of others. If you are a part of a party that publicly disrespects the government, of course people also have the right to tell you that you are not thinking wisely. Just as you have the right to pursue stupidity, people have the right to tell you that you are pursuing stupidity and you need to change the course of action. It is your right again to say yes or stay put. But clearly, it is now establish locally and internationally that the actions of
 the CDC in these elections have been just unacceptable. Your action to undermine the democratic gains at this time is unfortunate. I am one person with the opinion that despite the leadership chllenges faced by the CDC, they still have the potential to produce leaders in the future, eventhough it may be to my dislike but will have to accept to respect the democratic will of the people. CDC has one nemesis and that has been PresidentEllenJohnsonSirleaf. If PresidentEllenJohnsonSirleaf had stuck to her one term promise, perhaps CDC could be producing the next government. But your actions that have led to the destruction of lives and properties now speak volumes about the inability of the CDC to govern a civilize state.WinstonTubman is not the man and you all know it. You have blown those potentials in the breeze only because guys like you are desperate for power to once again loot the coffers of the nation. However, in Liberia, anything is possible.

I know there are groups like http://www.facebook.com/groups/discussingliberia/ (for general Liberia news and politics), http://www.facebook.com/groups/electionsmediamonitoring/ (for Liberia elections), http://www.facebook.com/groups/120274546039/ (youth empowerment and unity discussions), and http://www.facebook.com/groups/Liberiaprofessionalnetwork/ (ONLY for business discussions and professional networking).

Again, it has been a wonderful experience and thanks to all of you for engaging. Even in our disagreement, I hope and pray we always think about Liberia first and put our differences, political parties, views and everything else second.

"Front Page Africa online news: :The Press Union of Liberia has questioned the GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s honesty  about controlling Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhate messageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as justification for the overnight  seizure of three media entities in Monrovia and urges the government to  stop its intimidation against the media.
The PUL says the Monday night police action and seizure of the three  media institutions is simply an attempt to silent dissent and force the  media into submission, describing the court order as a cover up.PUL  says while it acknowledges the authority of the court, it warned that  the court and police actions should not go side-by-side and therefore  urges the court to dismiss the unwarranted petition.The PUL  finds it hard to accept that the court would surrender its authority to  the police to invade the premises of the stations and dispossess the  owners of their properties.Notwithstanding the police action,  the Union says it will ensure the appearance of the three institutions  in court on Thursday and calls on all journalists to assemble at the  Court to show solidarity.The Criminal Court Ã¢â‚¬ËœAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ on Monday night  cited the managements of Sarafina Communications, Royal Communications  and the Infinity Corporation for a conference on November 10 relative to  a petition filed by the Ministries of Justice and Information alleging  Ã¢â‚¬Å“hate message.Ã¢â‚¬ÂMeanwhile the Union has renewed calls for  Liberia journalists to play a stabilizing role especially in the face  of MondayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s standoff between CDC supporters and the police in Monrovia,  describing the fracas as unfortunate.The Union says the  elections are by now over and journalists need to exercise the highest  degree of social responsibility in handling the aftermath of the  election to avoid any post elections violence.PUL says MondayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s  incident represents the singular most explosive disruption in the  elections that could degenerate further unless journalists rejected  partisan reporting that would fuel passion.The Union also calls  on Ambassadors WinstonTubman and George Weah to abandon any further  protest action for the sake of the security of their supporters and the  rest of the population.PUL at the same time calls on state  security not to get unnecessarily drawn into the inflammatory comments  coming from politicians to endanger the already fragile peace.""","Ushahidi Liberia","2011-11-10 12:30:00",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
"Global News Network Liberia: ""The opposition Liberty Party (LP) this  week issued added its voice on several issues as its relate to the  growth and development of the Liberia nation, including the recent  closure of three media institutions by the Liberia Government.    Fellow Liberia and Foreign Friends:The Liberty Party  strongly condemns the violence of November 7, 2011 and calls on all,  particularly the national security forces, to exercise restraint and  self-control to ensure that our nation does not return to the days of  fear and instability. We call on the National Legislature to appoint an  independent counsel or committee to probe the violence without delay and  to take the appropriate action to ensure our Nation does not continue  on this path.We regret the loss of lives and destruction of  properties, and extend our prayers and sympathies to all the victims and  their families. of the unfortunate event. We believe such violence  deprives our people of the kind of national conversation that is needed  to further an atmosphere of democracy.The Liberty Party believes  that our NationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past of civil conflicts which left many of our fellow  Liberia dead, handicapped, exiled or displaced, is one we cannot  afford to return to. For the sake of our people who are still trying to  mend their lives and are making every effort to nurture our fragile  Ã¢â‚¬Å“DemocracyÃ¢â‚¬Â, the Liberty Party calls on all Liberia not to permit  political differences to supersede our national interest and take us  back to the dark days of our NationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history. The government has an especially important responsibility to ensure that the activities of state security remain within the law."" Signed,James M.V. YougieDeputy National Secretary General for OperationsLiberty PartySTATEMENT ON THE CLOSURE OF CERTAIN MEDIA INSTITUTIONSLiberty  Party is disturbed by reports that government security forces,  purportedly acting under color of law, has enforced the closure of three  licensed radio stations in Monrovia. We are especially concerned that  such action, coming, as it did, immediately following the reporting by  the media institutions of the violence that led to the death of our  fellow Liberia and the destruction of properties, has the appearance  of an attempt by the Government to muzzle free press. The fact that the  Liberia people were deprived of reporting of election activities on  November 8, 2011, by all media institutions is also sad.We are,  therefore, calling for the immediate reopening of those stations! The  right to freedom of speech and of the press, thought and conscience  without interference of the State is jealously guarded by Article 15 of  the Constitution of our Republic and must be a bedrock tenet of our  fledgling democratic dispensation.The events leading up to the  run-off elections notwithstanding, we must caution the Government that  only a declaration of a State of Emergency can operate to deprive people  of their fundamental rights. In the absence of such declaration, no  legal writ should lie to cause the closure of media institutions and  interfere with that fundamental right of speech, without due process of  law. If individuals take to the public airwaves and engage in hate  speech then they must be held individually responsible. Closing down an  entire station is not the type of individual responsibility envisioned  under our constitution.Liberty Party is fully aware of the  Government's compelling interest in ensuring the security, welfare and  well being of its citizens and all those within our borders. But the  Government must always be cognizant of the constitutional and  fundamental rights of its citizens. The need to act with  restraint and forbearance during these very difficult and volatile times  cannot be overemphasized. Liberty Party calls upon the Government to  exercise restraint in dealing with difficult issues, which traverse our  constitutional framework. Liberia cannot afford to abandon the  democratic path by shutting down radio stations because we dislike the  speech. Such ugliness should be things of our painful past! We call on  the Government to pull away from the brink of what is certainly a  dangerous precipice. Our fledgling democracy must not play into our  worse fears about each other, but engender a spirit of hope in our  future, ever confident that together we can be a great nation. In  our national interest, we call upon the government of President Ellen  EllenJohnsonSirleaf to reopen the closed stations, without delay.Signed,James M.V.

My condolence goes to the family/families for the lost of their love one/onesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ the incidence is lamentable. We need peace and reconciliation more than ever beforeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦We also have to respect the rule of law tooÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Anyone living in Liberia knows for a fact that all election campaigning activities had come to an endÃ¢â‚¬Â¦& that no political party had the right to take to the streets a day before the run-off election.

"Moses Carter I am sure u have not taken time to read my post, and for the record, I am a person of law, the best way to halt a media operation is through the courts, so I think in my judgement, the govt acted under the law. Now lets talk the Peter case, I dont see Peter in this matter, I see the PUL. My post didnt mentioned anything about Peter so u are wrong and own me an apology. Secondly, I listen to Mr, Quaqua on Truth FM and read their PUL Press Release which agrees that indeed there are sufficient grounds to close the media houses but the govet needs to include other entities like Truth FM. Now, my point is, if the PUL agrees that these now closed institutions have aired hate messages and violated ethically what did the PUL do in curtailing these professional violations? Is the PUL saying journalists or media institutions can air any anti peace message or violate ethically and its sau nothing but condemn the govt when the court takes an action? where is the best place to carry a media house, I think the court. Peter problem here is why the court used the police? And this is strange to me, becuz of my journalistic coverage of the court, police officers have always been at the court to effect arrest and other actions, why is Peter surprise by this?

Well, how it sounds when you are taken to court and asked to provide evidence to indict yourself? The burden of proof lies with the accuser so in this case, the government of Liberia should be the one to provide evidence to the court that the stations were indeed spreading hate messages.

"@Henson King I dont know if u are a journalist, but in this profession of ours, u dont condemn RIGHT u condemn WRONG. Now if Mr. Quaqua is condeming the govt for using the court to halt the operation of stations it claims were issuing anti peace messages, it pre-supposes that they were wrong in using the court to effect the closure, therefore,it thinks otherwise. So I am asking, becuz I am aware that it should be the court that should handle these kinds of actions, not just the Ministry of Informations as the case was in the past. So I think the PUL is in error here, with all purpose and intend, the courts are the best place to take ur case.

"Big broda, the issue here is about working together. I think the fact that the Government failed to even communicate to the Union of these ethical problems but instead took the decision of shutting those entities down speaks to the fact that they are only willing to cooperate with the Union in some respects but not in important cases as such that require the intervention of the Union. I have also been of the opinion that Peter as head of the Union has been too lenient on dealing with ethical transgressions during the elections. At the media Executive meeting with political stakeholders, that was a major point that I emphasized to him that the Union is responsible for all the ethical bridges that were unfolding. A case in point was the Sam Deen's publication where he reported on his frontpage captioned: ""Fromayan Toilet On Himself"". I strongly criticized such publication and told Peter that the Union needed to have punished Sam Deen for such publication. These are the things if were done, would have enhance the reportage of media houses in promoting peace.

"It is unfortunate that Liberia died as a result of complete foolishness displayed by socalled politicians. There was no need for any demonstration. CDC had announced that they would boycott the elections and everybody knew this. They should have press their case further afterwards and inform the international community that the government lacks credibility. CDC knew they wanted this because the call for demonstartion at that crucial time of the elections was intended to disrupt the process and if CDC was a government they could not allow that. The party had made its positions clear that it will not honor anything from the government. That in itself is chaos by itself. Do you expect CDC demonstrators to remain in the compound if the police told them to do so? They would come out to challenge the police because the party officials had told them not to honor anything coming from the government. Unless people are saying here they should have allow the CDC to block the roads and loot people properties as they started to do already when the triot broke out. The police had to quell the situation. Now the circumstances leading to the death of people is what needs to be explained. This is why the investigation is important. Unconfirmed reports I am getting suggest that there were attempts by some CDCians to disarm an officer. Unless Foeday and others also believe that the officer in question, if this is true, should have alowed himself to be disarmed and butchered by the mob. Again, the investigation would not mean anything to CDC because the party does not respect any position coming from the government. I am saddened that Foeday and others would be advocating for a lawless society. The UP government is on records of being the most tolerant government in Liberia's recent past. People have called and abuse the president on talk shows. The CDC chairman and secretary general have abused the office of the presidency and go sound to sleep as long as those actions did not directly affect the peace and stability of the country. An attempt by demonstrators to unlawfully take matters into their own hands and ignore warnings from the international community that is under obligation to protect protesters like in the case of Libya only meant that the government had to take a stance to halt the lawlessness. It has ledto the death of individuals which is regrettable but the government had to act in swift response.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-10 15:06:20","Alvin Johnson",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The only problem we have is the loss of life which we all regret, but I think when a security force is at the point of being run over especially near the residence of the president and after some high ranking CDCians have promised doom's days for Liberia with some saying that they will make Liberia ungovernable, some force must be used to quell the heat.

Your mom, she's the administrator of the money, so we'll call her the Government. We're here to take care of ur needs, so we'll call you the people. The nanny, we'll consider her the working class. And ur baby brother, we'll call him the future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense. So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the has severely soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, 'Dad, I think I undertand the concept of politics now'. The father says, 'Good son' tell me in ur own words what you think politics is all about'. The little boy replies, 'well, while capitalism is screwing the working class, the Government is sound asleep, the people are being ignored and the future is in deep shit'.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-10 15:37:03","Manah K O Sambola",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Taylor used the law to shut down Radio Veritas,  Star Radio and your own News Newspaper. During that time, the ministers of Doe and Taylor hailed them for upholding the law. Today, the same ministers say Doe and Taylor  are tyrants.   I do agree that the media should exercise its social responsibility in exercising its freedom.  Frankly with the exception of UNMIL Radio, most media institutions took sides.   They were divided among opposition and government. So when drastic action is taken against one group, it raises the head of the ugly hydra. I also agree that the PUL should not only discuss the shutting down of the media institutions but also discuss the unnecessary violent protest.  We have done much harm to Liberia.

"@ Benetta Fofana, get me right my dear. I was only objectively analyzing the issues being raised here about Peter's position on the government draconian action. To restate again, I think it is a shared responsibility between the government of Liberia and the Press Union's leadership. My reason is that little efforts were exerted by the union to curtail ethical transgressions of media houses. If they had taken drastic actions on media houses threading in unethical reporting,  today, we would not have reach this far. I even emphasized this to Peter on last Saturday at the Media Executive Meeting at the Corina Hotel, but  he thought I was joking. I told Peter that politicians will always remain politicians. They deal in rhetorics and  act like they are sincere about issues and collaboration. Including the Ministry of Information, the Government of Liberia is a threading much in rhetorics than sincerity in the way issues are addressed. I believe, if some do not have much to provide the discussion here, its better for them to remain quiet.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-10 16:27:38","Moses Carter",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

None of these journalists spoke in the collective interest of journalists.   Journalism like any other profession will have some low days.

In a petition filed before the judge of Criminal Court A on November 7, 2011, the state sought the permanent cancellation of the broadcast licenses of the four institutions claiming that the respondents illegally used their respective media outlets to broadcast hate messages against the Government and deliberately disseminated misinformation and messages of violence, instigating the people to rise up and take to the streets, amongst others.
In its petition, the State prayed that the court grant a request for temporary closure of the institutions pending a hearing, and subsequent to the hearing, ordered a permanent closure of Power FM and TV Station, Love FM and TV, Kings FM and Clar TV and Shatta FM.
Having reviewed the merits of the petition, LMC and CEMESP unequivocally condemn governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action to shut down the media outlets as this action clearly infringes on the petitionerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to due process.
While the LMC and CEMESP frown on the spreading of inflammatory rhetorics on the radio and in the newspaper, we are equally alarmed by the arbitrariness of governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions and the Criminal CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal granting of a legally defective petition. In its petition the Government of Liberia failed to state the law that was violated in count three of its petition.
Further, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition was defective as it failed to disclose a concise Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause of action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  According to Civil Procedure Law Section 16.5Ã¢â‚¬Â-each petition shall comply with the rules of a complaint in an action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This means there must clearly be a stated action, in which this petition failed to provide. GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition which reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Petition for the closure of communications entitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â, sought a remedy, but did not state a cognizable cause of action.  
Especially disturbing was the fact that the petition for injunction and a temporary restraining order, usually reserved for civil suits, was filed in the criminal court.  Essentially it means that the court did not and does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the Liberia Law Revised, Volume 40, in the case of Lamin v. Save the Children fund, the Supreme Court stated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“circuit courts are statutory courts which derive their being and scope of powers from the statues creating them and cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond what is conferred by statute (Lamin et al Save The Children Fund UK, 1996).  The fact that the petition circumvents that fact makes it null and void from its very existence.  

Furthermore, assuming that criminal charges have been levied against the respondents, there has been no writ of summons or arrest issued against them. This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.
The Government also failed to mention the exact penal code the respondents violated.  Once again the fact that such words like petitioner and respondents were used clearly demonstrate that this was a civil matter and the court in this instance lacks jurisdiction over this matter. 
 Liberia Code of Laws Revised, Criminal Procedure Section 14.4 clearly states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The written complaint shall specify the nature of the offense charged and shall contain a concise statement of the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute such offense, and of the time and place of the commission of the offense, and of the time and place of commission of the offense and of the person, if any, against whom, and the thing, if any, in respect to which, the offense was committed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This procedure was not followed.
The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.  The action should be immediately rescinded and the Liberia Government should issue a public apology for this gross violation of fundamental rights.

It was also announced that the opposition CDC  has finally withdrew her case from the NEC and is now taking it to the Supreme Court, where it is expected to be determined in several days time, according to Liberia electoral laws. The electoral body has accordingly made a determination on it already in which it was established that no incident of fraud was observed during the first round of voting in Liberia.

"Article from New Democrat Nov 10th:
A  major split is looming in the opposition Congress for Democratic Change  (CDC) with    the chairman for recruitment and mobilization, Mr. Mulbah Morlu calling  on all CDC elected legislators to refuse their seats, but the elected  lawmakers have promptly rejected the call.
The  CDC won 15 legislative seats in the October 11 legislative presidential  elections, which the party later described as Ã¢â‚¬Å“fraudulentÃ¢â‚¬Â.
Mr.  Morlu said accepting the seats Ã¢â‚¬Å“will be a mockery for the CDC which said  the elections were bias and vowed not to recognize the governmentÃ¢â‚¬Â  resulting from there.
He  noted that their decision would be fully supported by the downtrodden  masses who, he said, have stood by the party over the years.
But  CDC Secretary General, Acarious Gray, who recently won Representative  seat for (Montserrado-District #8) quickly denounced MorluÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s statement,  explaining that the partyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hierarchy has not reached such a decision.
Geraldine  Doe-Sheriff, CDC Senator for Montserrado County who chairs the party,  was defiant, saying even if such move was to be made by the CDC, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I will  not give up my seatÃ¢â‚¬Â.
Ã¢â‚¬Å“Even if they tell us to waive our seats today, I will not do it. This is the only country that I know.
Ã¢â‚¬Å“The  issue of legislative positions is not what is on the floor now. Why  bring it upÃ¢â‚¬Â¦youÃ‚Â  [Morlu] canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hijack people like that. We are young  peopleÃ¢â‚¬Â¦you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do that. We have a future in this thing (politics),Ã¢â‚¬Â  she reacted to MorluÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s statement in an angry mood.

"Press statement from the Carter Center, Nov 10th:
Executive Summary
The Carter Center's election  observation mission finds that Liberia's Nov. 8 presidential run-off  election was conducted in general accordance with Liberia's legal  framework and its international obligations for democratic elections.  Regrettably, the election was marred by an opposition boycott, violence  on the eve of the election, and low voter turnout.
From a technical perspective, the  election was well-administered and on the whole polling staff carried  out their duties admirably at polling stations throughout the country.  The process was conducted transparently, with domestic and international  observers having access to all stages of the electoral process. These  positive aspects build upon the National Election Commission's (NEC)  performance in the first round and auger well for Liberia's technical  capacity to conduct credible and transparent elections in the future.
However, the events of the past week  show that important challenges to Liberia's democratic consolidation  remain. The opposition's decision to boycott the run-off was based on  their assertion that the overall election process was significantly  flawed. These claims remain unsubstantiated. In addition, the Liberia  National Police's (LNP) use of deadly force in an action against the  headquarters of the Congress for Democratic Change (CDC) on Nov. 7,  together with the closure of three media outlets, eroded confidence and  contributed to an atmosphere of fear, particularly in Monrovia. These  events suggest a significant failure of the political process to resolve  electoral disputes peacefully within the framework of the law.
To address these challenges, the  Center suggests a number of urgent steps: (1) We welcome President Ellen EllenJohnsonSirleaf's statement that there should be an investigation into  the events of Nov. 7. This investigation should be carried out in a  timely manner by an independent body to ensure a credible and  transparent inquiry with full accountability. (2) All parties should  respect the official election results, pending the resolution of any  legal challenges. (3) Liberia political leaders should redouble their  efforts for a genuine and inclusive political dialogue leading to  national reconciliation and governance reform.
The main findings of the Center's mission include:

The first round of the presidential  election held on Oct. 11 was found by international and domestic  observation groups to be credible, transparent, and without evidence of  significant irregularities or systematic fraud. Since none of the 16  candidates received 50 percent plus one of the votes, the top two  candidates, EllenJohnsonSirleaf of the Unity Party (UP) and WinstonTubman of the CDC automatically qualified for the run-off election held  on Nov. 8;
In spite of the quality of the first  round, the CDC decided to boycott the run-off election. While voting is a  right, rather than an obligation, and a party is free to encourage its  supporters not to participate, there is no legal provision in Liberia  for withdrawing in between the first and second round of the election.  The CDC's decision to boycott essentially denied the Liberia people a  genuine choice within a competitive electoral process;
The legal provisions regarding the  date of the run-off are not harmonized with the period in which results  from the first round may be challenged and adjudicated. In practice, the  NEC failed to issue decisions on several first round presidential  complaints prior to the holding of the run-off;
The CDC's march on Nov. 7 violated  provisions of the Code of Conduct for Political Parties that prohibit  parties from undertaking election-related activities within 24 hours of  the polls and was without proper authorization. While the march began  peacefully, it rapidly degenerated into a confrontation between CDC  supporters and the LNP that included CDC supporters throwing stones,  police firing tear gas, and later, an action by the LNP against the CDC  headquarters. Eyewitness accounts and video strongly suggest that the  LNP used excessive force and fired weapons on unarmed persons, resulting  in several deaths. Peacekeeping forces deployed by the United Nations  Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) played a critical role in restraining the LNP  and restoring order;
Events at the CDC headquarters were  followed by the detention of more than 80 alleged CDC supporters, the  closure of three media outlets, and the drawing up of a list of  individuals whose travel outside the country has been banned. On Nov. 9,  all detainees were released;
The atmosphere on election day was  subdued in Monrovia but largely calm throughout the rest of the country.  Although voter turnout appeared to be significantly lower than in the  first round, many Liberia, including some CDC supporters, were  determined to participate and they are to be commended for their  commitment to the democratic process;
Carter Center observers reported that  almost all polling stations throughout Liberia's 15 counties opened on  time and that voting and counting were generally well-administered and  transparent. Domestic observers were present in 52 percent of polling  places observed. In the absence of CDC's party agents, the Liberia  domestic observers provided an especially important safeguard for the  integrity of the process;
The Center finds that Liberia's  run-off election was conducted in general accordance with the country's  legal framework and international obligations, which provide for genuine  democratic elections. While the run-off was undermined by the CDC  boycott, the eruption of electoral violence, and low voter turnout, it  allowed Liberia who wished to participate to express their will in a  transparent and credible process. The Carter Center expresses its regret  at the loss of life during this electoral period.
BackgroundThe Carter Center  launched its election observation mission in Liberia in early September  2011, following an invitation from the NEC. Eight long-term observers  from five countries arrived in Liberia in early September to assess  campaigning and electoral preparations.
As in the first round, The Carter  Center and Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa  (EISA) partnered to deploy an integrated mission of 52 observers from 20  countries who visited polling stations in all 15 counties. The Carter  Center delegation was led by General Dr. Yakubu Gowon, former head of  state of Nigeria, along with Dr. John Stremlau, Carter Center vice  president for peace programs.
The Carter Center assesses Liberia's  elections against its obligations for democratic elections contained in  the Constitution, the Elections Law, and other relevant parts of the  legal framework, as well as its obligations under international law. The  Carter Center conducts its election observation activities in  accordance with the Declaration of Principles for International Election  Observation, which was adopted at the United Nations in 2005.
This statement is preliminary and  focuses on the period surrounding the run-off election. The Center will  continue to monitor the tally process and resolution of electoral  disputes. This statement supplements previous Carter Center reports  covering the campaign period; the voting and counting process; and the  tallying process. A comprehensive final report, including detailed  recommendations, will be published within four months of the end of the  electoral process.

"Liberia MEDIA UNDER SERIOUS ATTACK... GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO PRODUCE EVIDENCE

The Government of Liberia has failed to produce evidence against three media institutions it says were broadcasting inflammatory and hate  messages a day before the run-off elections.

Appearing before the Criminal Court A Thursday, the government represented by Solicitor General Wilkins Wright ordered the court to issue a subpoena requesting the stations to produce evidence against themselves.

THIS IS A REPORT

The criminal court A at the Temple of Justice was a dramatic scene today when the government of Liberia represented by solicitor general Wilkins Wright failed to produce substantive evidence in the case involving the closure of three media institutions by the government.

The court jam-packed with local and international journalists along with legal minds witnessed what should have been a conference between media managers and the government but eventually turned into a hearing where Cllr. Wright and prosecution team raised several motions and injections asking the defendants; Power TV, Kings FM and Love FM to produce evidence.

The Prosecution Cllr. Wright asked the court to issue a writ on the three media institutions to produce evidence; something which legal minds termed as a scare tactics on the part of government to muster the press.

Peter Quiqui in a very disturbed mood questioned the credibility of government.

The Press Union of Liberia President reemphasized that the move by the Unity Party led government is intended to intimidate the media.

Mr. Quiqui termed the government the government decision to shut-down the media institutions as strange and very troubling for Liberia's democracy.

Aaron Kollie, a veteran Liberia Journalist and owner of the Infinity Corporation - Power FM/TV called on the EllenJohnsonSirleaf led government to with immediate effect open the media institutions.

He said the government action is pre-medidated and intended to clam-down on the Press something which it has boost for over the years.

The Criminal Court A has adjourned the case to a later date.

According to 15 section c of the 1986 Liberia Constitution; there shall be no limitation on the public right to be informed about government and its functionaries; but critics are wondering whether this right will be achieved by the Unity Party led government with latest action.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-10 18:28:31","Moses Browne",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Acting Chairman, National Elections Commission (NEC)


Ladies and Gentlemen of the Press, My Fellow Liberia

The National Elections Commission wishes to congratulate all registered voters that turned out to vote in the Presidential Run-off Election conducted on November 8, 2011, for their patriotism and good deportment exhibited during the election.

The Commission further wishes to express heartfelt thanks to all field staff including poll workers, many of whom spent sleepless hours in ensuring that the election succeeded.   

Special thanks and appreciation go to the leadership and officers of the joint security forces for helping to provide the enabling environment for the successful conduct of the Presidential Run-off election.

To our international partners, observer groups and the media, we sincerely appreciate your role and involvement throughout the process.

Distinguished ladies and gentlemen of the press, we are pleased to report that the electoral process has been successfully implemented as planned. Polls opened in most places on time and since we had only one ballot paper with two candidates in the race, the counting of votes has been much faster this time. 

PROVISIONAL RESULTS

As reported during our briefing to the press on Tuesday, November 8, 2011, immediately following the close of the polls, the reconciliation, sorting and counting of votes commenced at all polling places across the country. The result of each polling place was placed on the wall for public viewing, in addition to distribution of copies to party agents that were present. The original copy of results from each polling place was placed in a Tamper Evident Envelope and taken to the magisterial tally center for processing.

The tallying of election results commenced across the country early Wednesday morning at all magisterial tally centers in the presence of local and international observer groups, the media, as well as party agents.

I must clarify that because the run-off was one election with only two candidates in the race, the tally process is also proceeding much faster than during the October 11 elections.

I wish to remind the parties that complaints regarding polling/counting or tallying irregularities should be filed with the NEC Magistrate Offices. We further wish to report that to date, the NEC has received no complaints regarding the November 8, 2011 Presidential Run-off Election.

The National Elections Commission will now proceed with the announcement of the first provisional results from the November 8, 2011 Presidential Run-off Election.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-10 18:39:20","Stevie Fleming Railey",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"What is Reconciliation in your mind ? Somebody please define Reconciliation for me. Dont forget the people of Liberia are not enemies and will never be enemies of one another for no reason, yes we will disagree on the path of our country from time to time, but naturally, we remain brothers and sisters. But what brand of reconciliation are you referring to ? The one where state police killed in cold blood innocent, unarmed Liberia whose only crime was  to assembled and raised their objection peacefully ? Oh so now its time to let by gones be bygones, anyso ? Or are we talking the reconciliation where the fourth estate refused to play by the rules, their independent roles, as watch dogs of society; thus assuring an equitable and just society but rather dabble in kato and yellow journalism ? And now this same fourth estate is now doing the bidding (Public relations) for the same govermnment, guilty of killing the innocent ones; now calling for reconciliation, is this the reconciliation you are talking about ? Or reconciliation has all of a sudden now become paramount now that the madamEllenJohnsonSirleaf has won the election by whatever means ? ITS TIME FOR NATION BUILDING NOW, NOT SO ? IS THIS YOUR BRAND OF RECONCILIATION ? What is reconciliation to you ? When one group continues to monopolise state resources at the disadvantaged of the vast majority of the people of Liberia; in your mind will that ever result into reconciliation ? One group presiding over all the resources and not bothering to open the economic net to other capable Liberia, infact leaving all perceived enemies of the the state out; yet you sit there and talk about reconciliation ? Dear what do you understand reconciliation to mean ? You balling from the country's resources whilst aother people continue to wallor in poverty; yet you are calling for a national conference, to talk about what, reconciliation ? A lot of Liberia were killed in cold blood on monday this week by state security personnel, investigations is not ongoing from any credible independent group; no finding/s have been declared, we dont as yet know what the president role was, who ordered the murders of these innocent CDCIANS/Liberia, why live ammunitions were used, all these are questions yet to be unanswered; in the absense of this how can you realistically call for reconciliation ? Reconciation with whom ? they say what goes around comes around; you ever heard of that ? Reconciliation on what basis ?

Some of the paths we can take in Liberia today is to seriously address some of the causes of our woes. I am afraid that moving is not going to be enough. Pretty soon, we would be here again.

"MOST OBJECTIVE STATEMENT YET!

Monitor: Liberia Elections Democratic Despite Opposition Claims

Election observers from the Carter Center say Liberia's presidential run-off this week was credible and met international standards for democratic elections.
In a statement Thursday, the U.S.-based monitoring group said democracy in Liberia still faces Ã¢â‚¬Å“important challenges.Ã¢â‚¬Â But the Carter Center dismissed as Ã¢â‚¬Å“unsubstantiatedÃ¢â‚¬Â claims by the opposition that the election process was seriously flawed.
.....

The Liberia government has also been criticized for responding to the unrest by closing three pro-opposition radio stations. The Carter Center said the events suggest a Ã¢â‚¬Å“significant failureÃ¢â‚¬Â by the government to legally resolve electoral disputes.

The monitoring group urged Mrs.EllenJohnsonSirleaf to move quickly to appoint an independent panel to investigate the use of deadly force against protesters.

It also called on ALL SIDES to respect the official election results and ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE that leads to national reconciliation and political reform. #AMEN!!!

"MOST OBJECTIVE STATEMENT YET!

Monitor: Liberia Elections Democratic Despite Opposition Claims

Election observers from the Carter Center say Liberia's presidential run-off this week was credible and met international standards for democratic elections.
In a statement Thursday, the U.S.-based monitoring group said democracy in Liberia still faces Ã¢â‚¬Å“important challenges.Ã¢â‚¬Â But the Carter Center dismissed as Ã¢â‚¬Å“unsubstantiatedÃ¢â‚¬Â claims by the opposition that the election process was seriously flawed.
.....

The Liberia government has also been criticized for responding to the unrest by closing three pro-opposition radio stations. The Carter Center said the events suggest a Ã¢â‚¬Å“significant failureÃ¢â‚¬Â by the government to legally resolve electoral disputes.

The monitoring group urged Mrs.EllenJohnsonSirleaf to move quickly to appoint an independent panel to investigate the use of deadly force against protesters.

It also called on ALL SIDES to respect the official election results and ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE that leads to national reconciliation and political reform. #AMEN!!!

"MOST OBJECTIVE STATEMENT YET!

Monitor: Liberia Elections Democratic Despite Opposition Claims

Election observers from the Carter Center say Liberia's presidential run-off this week was credible and met international standards for democratic elections.
In a statement Thursday, the U.S.-based monitoring group said democracy in Liberia still faces Ã¢â‚¬Å“important challenges.Ã¢â‚¬Â But the Carter Center dismissed as Ã¢â‚¬Å“unsubstantiatedÃ¢â‚¬Â claims by the opposition that the election process was seriously flawed.
.....

The Liberia government has also been criticized for responding to the unrest by closing three pro-opposition radio stations. The Carter Center said the events suggest a Ã¢â‚¬Å“significant failureÃ¢â‚¬Â by the government to legally resolve electoral disputes.

The monitoring group urged Mrs.EllenJohnsonSirleaf to move quickly to appoint an independent panel to investigate the use of deadly force against protesters.

It also called on ALL SIDES to respect the official election results and ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE that leads to national reconciliation and political reform. #AMEN!!!

"MOST OBJECTIVE STATEMENT YET!

Monitor: Liberia Elections Democratic Despite Opposition Claims

Election observers from the Carter Center say Liberia's presidential run-off this week was credible and met international standards for democratic elections.
In a statement Thursday, the U.S.-based monitoring group said democracy in Liberia still faces Ã¢â‚¬Å“important challenges.Ã¢â‚¬Â But the Carter Center dismissed as Ã¢â‚¬Å“unsubstantiatedÃ¢â‚¬Â claims by the opposition that the election process was seriously flawed.
.....

The Liberia government has also been criticized for responding to the unrest by closing three pro-opposition radio stations. The Carter Center said the events suggest a Ã¢â‚¬Å“significant failureÃ¢â‚¬Â by the government to legally resolve electoral disputes.

The monitoring group urged Mrs.EllenJohnsonSirleaf to move quickly to appoint an independent panel to investigate the use of deadly force against protesters.

It also called on ALL SIDES to respect the official election results and ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE that leads to national reconciliation and political reform. #AMEN!!!

"Deddeh Howard, you took the observation out my mouth. It's good that you pointed it out, because I would've never said it like the way you did. Just to add on; this is the reason why some Liberia haven't been so successful at public speaking,,, They find it difficult to connect just by the things they say or how they said it. My dad told me a very funny story; he said one Mr. Zarpah Liberty (stand to be corrected on the first name spelling) came to speak to freshman students at LU. Through out his hour long speech, he used so so big big vocab which deprived a lot of students from understanding what he was saying. Yet, according to my dad, some of his peers kept clapping at the use of a big word. After the speech, my dad decided to ask one of the guys who was sitting next to him, who happens to be one of those clapping. He asked,""What was honorable Liberty actually saying, did you understand him?"" The guy replied, ""I really didn't understand half of what the man said, but the man know book ma man."" LOL!!! LMBO!!!! Look, that was the most hilarious thing I ever heard!!! How in the world you don't understand what somebody is saying, yet you clapping at what he's saying? I didn't have the privilege of growing up in Liberia like others, but it seems this is the way they show others how educated they are. Speaking all those big vocabs in the wrong context. Words means a whole lot and I respect that, but there is a place and time to speak like that. The funny part is most of them can't even open their mouths' when they're are around real academics, but they tried to kill us with their so called big big english... I just be reading laughing out loud. Stephen Johnson, do you know who Mr.Zarpah Liberty is? lol","Liberia Elections","2011-11-11 00:57:16","Robert David G",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"Well, having read the article, I think Mulbah Morlu struck a point. It would be politically expedient for CDC to repeat the post election history of 1985 when elected lawmakers of the Liberia Action Party led by then elected Senator of Montsorrado County Ellen JonhsonEllenJohnsonSirleaf refused to take their respective seats in the National Legislature based on election fraudulent. It would be the biggest political mockery of the century if CDC elected lawmakers take their seats amidst the controversy surrounding the October 11 elections which the party claimed was characterized by irregularities. But let's wait to see if the likes of Geraldine Doe, Acarious Gray and others will put party's interest before self.","Liberia Media Monitoring","2011-11-11 04:08:28","Charles Crawford",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"My brother, I tried the best that I can to avoid participating in  discussions that is off no substance. Like everyone on this forum, I reserved the rights to comment or not on any post, and I exercised such right on this post. I didn't mentioned your name any where in my previous comments, but you took the time to address me, and I responded accordingly. As the self imposed President of the product of your equation, I would think you would've been able to determined when an accusation is actually being made, but your lack of understanding have lead you the wrong way. Again, if i may ask; why are you the only one so adamate about the simple point being made on this post? To the extend where you went out your way to make mentioned of me? That is enough reason to assume that this post affected you and your usage of words ineffectively. I rested my case because I don't have the time to engage you insubstantially. If you really wish to engage with me, I suggest we discuss something that will be a benefit to Liberia. Like educational reform in Liberia, ways we can get kids who lack the financial means to develop themselves off the streets and in the class rooms, In which capacities can we as citizens help in creating jobs, opening businesses in Liberia etc... I'm more than ready to engage you on these important issues. Not one where we have a sensitive guy making something out of nothing. BTW, FB is not where i use big words to impress my friends, I use them when its necessary. I hope I was clear for your understanding Mr. Varney Clarke.

"While Killing is never necessary, you can not ignore  the fact that the police was provoked to retaliate in the way they did.  1.Our Constitution is meant to be the backbone of our society, its meant to represent us as a culture,as a race of people with one common goal. we are suppose to uphold it as part of us. when people start breaking that down , does that not break our culture? why did we have to change the rules for a few. The elections guidelines are deprived form our Constitution we are meant to uphold it. our nation will never grow if we do not start upholding  our own laws and regulations; which is the social contract mandated to keep all men/women free in our country, when we start tearing that social contract down does it not take rights away from the people who decided to follow it.the elections where meant to be held on the day it held because that is what was agreed on.  .If we start breaking the basic foundation of rules and regulations that are put in place to govern us, when will we stopWhen will we start be law abiding. when will we have structure if we don't let our backbones to grow through our constitution. WHEN will it stop, when will we stop letting personal emotions and ego govern us. the right to voter is the voice that every Liberia has. why would you muzzle that right.2. from my understand in Liberia in order to protest you need to register and be recognized( this is also one of our social contract , put in place to keep people safe) this was never met  by the protesters.you as a citizen can do whatever you want in you yard but once you bring it to the public it is the government job to make sure that the public is not in danger, which from my understanding is what the police was doing. this all has to do with following the rules that are put in place to guide us as a nation. if we dont have these rules, than what expresses us as a nation?","Liberian Observer Facebook","2011-11-11 03:15:05","Victor A Ukatu",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"LMC/CEMESP Condemn Govt. Systematic Media Clampdown
Monrovia, Liberia
November 9, 2011
The Liberia Media Center and the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building categorically condemn the Liberia Government for the illegal closure of four broadcast entities in Liberia. 
In a petition filed before the judge of Criminal Court A on November 7, 2011, the state sought the permanent cancellation of the broadcast licenses of the four institutions claiming that the respondents illegally used their respective media outlets to broadcast hate messages against the Government and deliberately disseminated misinformation and messages of violence, instigating the people to rise up and take to the streets, amongst others.
In its petition, the State prayed that the court grant a request for temporary closure of the institutions pending a hearing, and subsequent to the hearing, ordered a permanent closure of Power FM and TV Station, Love FM and TV, Kings FM and Clar TV and Shatta FM.
Having reviewed the merits of the petition, LMC and CEMESP unequivocally condemn governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action to shut down the media outlets as this action clearly infringes on the petitionerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to due process.
While the LMC and CEMESP frown on the spreading of inflammatory rhetorics on the radio and in the newspaper, we are equally alarmed by the arbitrariness of governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions and the Criminal CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal granting of a legally defective petition. In its petition the Government of Liberia failed to state the law that was violated in count three of its petition.
Further, GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition was defective as it failed to disclose a concise Ã¢â‚¬Å“cause of action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  According to Civil Procedure Law Section 16.5Ã¢â‚¬Â-each petition shall comply with the rules of a complaint in an action.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This means there must clearly be a stated action, in which this petition failed to provide. GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s petition which reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Petition for the closure of communications entitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â, sought a remedy, but did not state a cognizable cause of action.  
Especially disturbing was the fact that the petition for injunction and a temporary restraining order, usually reserved for civil suits, was filed in the criminal court.  Essentially it means that the court did not and does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the Liberia Law Revised, Volume 40, in the case of Lamin v. Save the Children fund, the Supreme Court stated that Ã¢â‚¬Å“circuit courts are statutory courts which derive their being and scope of powers from the statues creating them and cannot exercise jurisdiction beyond what is conferred by statute (Lamin et al Save The Children Fund UK, 1996).  The fact that the petition circumvents that fact makes it null and void from its very existence.  

Furthermore, assuming that criminal charges have been levied against the respondents, there has been no writ of summons or arrest issued against them. This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.
The Government also failed to mention the exact penal code the respondents violated.  Once again the fact that such words like petitioner and respondents were used clearly demonstrate that this was a civil matter and the court in this instance lacks jurisdiction over this matter. 
 Liberia Code of Laws Revised, Criminal Procedure Section 14.4 clearly states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The written complaint shall specify the nature of the offense charged and shall contain a concise statement of the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute such offense, and of the time and place of the commission of the offense, and of the time and place of commission of the offense and of the person, if any, against whom, and the thing, if any, in respect to which, the offense was committed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This procedure was not followed.
The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.  The action should be immediately rescinded and the Liberia Government should issue a public apology for this gross violation of fundamental rights.

This writ of summons would have effectively brought the respondents or defendants under the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jurisdiction (Honor. Alexander Zoe v. George Tulay, 1997).   Failure to do so, regardless if the criminal court was the proper jurisdiction, is a blatant error.
The Government also failed to mention the exact penal code the respondents violated.  Once again the fact that such words like petitioner and respondents were used clearly demonstrate that this was a civil matter and the court in this instance lacks jurisdiction over this matter. 
 Liberia Code of Laws Revised, Criminal Procedure Section 14.4 clearly states that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The written complaint shall specify the nature of the offense charged and shall contain a concise statement of the acts of the defendant alleged to constitute such offense, and of the time and place of the commission of the offense, and of the time and place of commission of the offense and of the person, if any, against whom, and the thing, if any, in respect to which, the offense was committed.Ã¢â‚¬Â  This procedure was not followed.
The fact that the petition was filed in the wrong court (criminal instead of civil) which lacked jurisdiction, coupled with serious defects such as lack of stated action, the fact that no charge or complaint was filed, and no rule of law or penal code cited, renders the whole petition defective and void ab initio.  The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s granting of the temporary restraining order that temporarily closed these media outlets has no basis in law and thus should be immediately rescinded.  
Finally, LMC and CEMESP believe the Liberia Government acted to close the four broadcast entities in a drastic attempt to suppress speech, muzzle the press, violate fundamental freedom and crush dissent.  The action should be immediately rescinded and the Liberia Government should issue a public apology for this gross violation of fundamental rights.
